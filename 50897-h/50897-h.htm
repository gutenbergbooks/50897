    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.&mdash;THE SHARK-CHARMER WALKS THE PLANK.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>ack! I say, Jack!
      there's a row among the boatmen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sturdy, thick-set young fellow of seventeen was Jack, with low-hung
      fists of formidable size, and a love for anything in the shape of a row
      that constantly led him into scrapes. Hot-headed though he was, he was one
      of the most good-humoured, well-meaning young fellows in the world, who,
      while he would not hurt a fly if he could help it, was always ready to
      fight in defence of his own or another's rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      His chum, Roydon Leigh&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rdquo; for short&mdash;was of an altogether
      different type of young manhood. Jack's senior by a year, he was tall for
      his age, standing five feet ten in his stockings. His lithe, wiry frame
      contrasted strongly with Jack's sturdier build, as did his Scotch
      &ldquo;canniness&rdquo; with that young gentleman's headlong impetuosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A row!&rdquo; cried Jack delightedly, as he rushed to the taffrail. &ldquo;Time, too;
      four weeks we've lain here, and never a hand in a single shindy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His companion laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for that,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you're not likely to have a hand in this, unless
      you take the boat and row off to the diving grounds. All the same, there's
      a jolly row on&mdash;look yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The schooner <i>Wellington</i> rode at anchor at the northern extremity of
      the Strait of Manaar, on the famous pearl-fishing grounds of Ceylon. On
      her larboard bow lay the coast&mdash;a string of low, white sand-hills,
      dotted with the dark-brown thatch of fisher huts and the vivid green of
      cocoa-nut palms. The hour was eight o'clock in the morning of a cloudless
      March day; the fitful land-breeze had died away, leaving the whole surface
      of the sea like billowy glass. Half-a-dozen cable's-lengths distant on the
      schooner's starboard quarter, a score or-more of native <i>dhonies</i> or
      diving-boats rose and dipped to the regular motion of the long
      ground-swell.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was towards these boats that Don pointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That something unusual had occurred was evident enough. Angry shouts
      floated across the placid water; and the native boatmen could be seen
      hurriedly pulling the boats together into a compact group about one
      central spot where the clamour was loudest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; cried Jack, after watching the boats for some time in silence,
      &ldquo;they're making for the schooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't half like the look of it,&rdquo; replied Don uneasily; &ldquo;they shouldn't
      leave the diving grounds, you know, until the signal gun's fired. I wish
      the guv was here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wishing's no good when he's ashore,&rdquo; said Jack philosophically. &ldquo;You're
      the skipper <i>pro tem</i>., and you must make the most of your promotion,
      old fellow. We'll have some fun, anyhow. Whew! how those niggers pull, and
      what a jolly row they're making!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the excited cries, which had first attracted the attention of
      those upon the schooner's deck, had been exchanged by the boatmen for a
      weird chant, to which every oar kept time. Erect in the stern of the
      foremost boat an old whiteheaded <i>tyndal</i> or &ldquo;master&rdquo; led the song,
      while at the end of each measure a hundred voices raised a chorus that
      seemed fairly to lift the boats clear of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they singing, anyway?&rdquo; demanded Jack. &ldquo;There's something about a
      diver and a shark in it, but I can't half make it out, can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll call Puggles&mdash;he'll be able to tell us. Pug! Hi, Pug! come
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming, sa'b!&rdquo; answered a voice from the cook's galley; and almost
      simultaneously there appeared on deck the plumpest, shiniest, most
      good-natured looking black boy that ever displayed two raws of pearly
      teeth. Nature had, apparently, pulled him into the world by the nose, and
      then, as a sort of finishing touch to the job, had given that organ a
      sharp upward tweak and left it so. It was to this feature that Puggles
      owed his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pug,&rdquo; said his master, &ldquo;tell us what those boatmen yonder are singing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The black boy cocked his ears and listened for a moment with parted lips.
      &ldquo;Boat-wallahs this way telling, sa'b,&rdquo; said he; and, catching the strain
      of the chant, he repeated the words of each line as it fell from the lips
      of the old <i>tyndal</i>:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Salambo selling the diver one charm,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Salaam, Alii kum!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Old shark, he telling, then do no harm,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Salaam, Alii kum!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      One spotted shark come out the south,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Salaam, Alii kum!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      He taking diver's leg in his mouth,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Salaam, Alii kum!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Me big liking got, he telling, for you,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Salaam, Alii kum!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So he biting diver clean in two,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Salaam, Alii kum!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The lying charmer we take to the ship,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Salaam, Alii kum!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There he feeling bite of the sahib's whip,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Salaam, Alii kum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this Salambo must be the chap the guv had whipped off the grounds
      last season, eh, Pug?&rdquo; cried Don excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same black rascal, sa'b. His skin getting well, he coming back. Dey bring
      him 'board ship, make his skin sore two times,&rdquo; explained Puggles,
      grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; laughed Jack. &ldquo;We'll oblige 'em! We'll trice the fellow up!
      Hullo, here they come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boats having now reached the schooner, the chant ceased abruptly, the
      heavy oars were noisily shipped, and, amid a perfect Babel of voices, the
      boatmen came swarming up the sides, until the deck was one mass of wildly
      gesticulating, dusky humanity. The uproar was terrific.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old <i>tyndal</i>, who towered a full head and shoulders above his
      comrades, pushed his way to the front, and commanding silence among his
      followers, addressed himself to Don, who was always-recognised as master
      in his fathers absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sab.&rdquo; said he in pigeon English, &ldquo;one year back big sa'b ordering Salambo
      eat plenty blows for selling charm to diver-man. All same, this season he
      done come back and sell plenty charm, telling diver-man he put charm round
      neck, shark no eat him up. He telling plenty lie&mdash;this morning one
      shark done come, eat diver, charm, all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him stand forward,&rdquo; said Don, beginning to enter as much into the
      novelty of the thing as Jack himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The culprit, a sleek old fellow with shaven head, crafty eyes, and a
      rosary of wooden beads about his neck, was shoved to the front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you the chap who was whipped off the grounds last year for selling
      chaims?&rdquo; demanded Don.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your honour speaking true words.&rdquo; whined the shark-charmer, salaaming
      until his shaven head almost touched the deck; &ldquo;I same rascal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Jack,&rdquo; whispered Don, &ldquo;I shan't have him whipped, you know. We'll,
      make him walk the plank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital! Hell funk, certain, and there'll be no end of fun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well do it, then,&rdquo; said Don decidedly. &ldquo;Go forward and order two of the
      lascars to take the boat and lie under the schooner's quarter&mdash;-this
      side, you know&mdash;ready to pick him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In high glee Jack departed to execute this commission, while Don again
      turned to the shark-doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you happen to have one of those charms about you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One here got, sa'b,&rdquo; said the fellow, producing from the folds of his
      waist-cloth an <i>ola</i> or fragment of palm-leaf, covered with
      cabalistic characters. &ldquo;Sa'b no look at him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep it yourself,&rdquo; said Don; &ldquo;you'll soon need it. Hi, lascar!&rdquo; to one of
      the schooner's crew who stood near. &ldquo;Fetch a plank here and run it out
      over the side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the time the plank was brought and run out until one-half its length
      projected over the water, Jack came up chuckling, and by a sign intimated
      that the boat was in readiness. The crowd of natives, guessing that
      something unusual was afoot, craned their necks eagerly, while Puggles
      executed a comic <i>pas seul</i> in his delight. But the shark-charmer, as
      Jack had predicted, &ldquo;funked&rdquo; miserably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing that with the boat in waiting there was absolutely no danger to
      the shark-charmer's life, Don turned a deaf ear to his pleadings, and made
      a signal to the lascars to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      Willing hands seized the quaking wretch and dragged him to the schooner's
      side, where he was placed upon, the plank, Puggles standing on the
      deck-end to keep it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, Puggles!&rdquo; cried Don. &ldquo;One, two, three&mdash;let him slide!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Puggles jumped aside, the deck-end of the plank rose high in air, then
      descended with a crash; and with a scream of terror the shark-charmer
      disappeared over the side.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tremendous shout rose from the natives on deck, and with a common
      impulse they one and all rushed to the schooner's side, which they reached
      just as the shark-charmer's head reappeared above the surface. Another
      moment, and he was dragged into the boat, where, catching sight of the
      laughing faces ranged along the rail above, he shook his fist in mute
      menace, and so was rowed to shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teach the beggar a lesson he won't forget in a hurry,&rdquo; said Don, as he
      watched the boat recede. &ldquo;Good-bye, old boy; we're not likely to meet
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But in this sanguine forecast of the future he was mistaken, as events
      speedily proved.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. A STROKE OF LUCK AND AN AFTER-STROKE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was the
      afternoon of the day on which the shark-charmer so unwillingly walked the
      plank. The breeze was so light and fitful that it barely ruffled the
      surface of the sea about the schooner. Weary of the narrow limits of the
      deck, Don and his chum dropped into the boat and rowed ashore&mdash;Puggles,
      as a matter of course, bearing them company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These beastly sands are like an oven!&rdquo; growled Don, lifting his helmet to
      cool his dripping forehead. &ldquo;Where shall we go, Jack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bazaar,&rdquo; replied Jack laconically; &ldquo;always some fun to be had there. Pug,
      point for the bazaar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me pointing, sar,&rdquo; puffed the black boy, setting his dumpy legs in
      motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Puggles was never so much in his element as when thus strutting pompously
      in advance, warning common nigger humanity of the white sahibs' approach.
      At such times the disdainful tilt of his nose, the supreme
      self-complaisance of his expansive grin, were as good as a show.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gay and animated scene did the bazaar present. Back and forth through
      the temporary street surged an endless throng of natives of every shade of
      complexion and variety of costume&mdash;buying, selling, shouting,
      jabbering, drinking with friends or fighting with enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much cry and little wool,&rdquo; laughed Jack. &ldquo;There's a big black fellow
      yonder auctioning off some pearl oysters; let's have a go at the next
      lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; assented Don; &ldquo;perhaps we'll have a stroke of luck. The guv
      knew a poor half-caste once who bid in just such a chance lot as this, and
      in one of them he found sixty-eight thumping big pearls. Cleared thousands
      of pounds by that one bid, the guv says. Pug! here, Pug!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming, sa'b,&rdquo; gasped a faint voice, and Puggles wriggled his way from
      amongst the bystanders, shining with abundant perspiration and squeezed
      well-nigh flat by the pressure of the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pug,&rdquo; said his master, &ldquo;up on this creel with you, and when that big
      black fellow yonder puts up his next lot, bid 'em in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up went Puggles, nothing loth to escape further squeezing, and up went the
      auctioneer's next lot. In five minutes' time the few dozens of oysters
      composing the lot were knocked down to the black boy at an absurdly low
      figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are,&rdquo; said Don, handing him the coin. &ldquo;Pass that over, and fetch
      the things away till we see what's inside them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Making a dive for the oysters, Puggles scrambled them into his cloth, and
      followed the sahibs to the outskirts of the crowd, blowing like a
      porpoise. Finding a convenient patch of shade beneath a banyan tree within
      a few yards of the lazy surf, they proceeded to ascertain, without further
      delay, whether the shells contained anything of value.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him plenty smell got, anyhow,&rdquo; commented Puggles, as he arranged the
      oysters, which had been several days out of the water, in a small pyramid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack threw himself on the sand, and surveyed the rough, discoloured heap
      with unqualified disgust. &ldquo;They don't look very promising, I must say,&rdquo; he
      cried. &ldquo;Try that big one on top, Don.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inserting the blade of his pocket-knife between the shells of the bivalve,
      Don prized it open and carefully examined its contents. It contained
      nothing of any value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack looked listlessly on, while his companion opened shell after shell
      with no other result than the finding of two or three miserable specimens
      of pearls, so small that, as Jack laughingly said, &ldquo;one might stick them
      in ones eye and forget the moment after where one had put them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only three or four shells now remained unopened, and Don was on the point
      of abandoning the search in disgust, when Jack, who had edged himself on
      his elbow as close to the heap as the villainous odour of the decomposed
      oysters would allow, snatched up a shell of large size, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me have the knife a moment, will you? This looks promising&mdash;it's
      the biggest of the whole lot, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are, then; I've had enough of them myself,&rdquo; said Don, tossing
      him the knife and walking off.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not proceeded half-a-dozen yards, however, when a loud shout
      brought him back at a run. Jack and Puggles were eagerly bending over the
      opened oyster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked breathlessly, going down on his knees beside them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack thrust the half-shell towards him. It was literally filled with
      magnificent pearls. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * In 1828 no less than sixty-seven pearls were taken from a
     single oyster on these grounds.&mdash;J. K. H.
</pre>
    <p>
      Not a word was spoken as the glistening, priceless globules were carefully
      abstracted from their unsightly case and laid upon Pug's coffee-coloured
      palm. Twenty-five pearls of matchless size and brilliancy did Jack count
      out ere the store was exhausted. So taken up were they with their good
      fortune that not one of the three observed a native creep stealthily
      towards them under cover of the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's been nothing like it known on the grounds for years!&rdquo; cried Don
      excitedly. &ldquo;Any more, Jack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more,&rdquo; said Jack, and was about to throw the shell away, when Puggles
      caught his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, sar, stop! Me see something yellow in shell. Stick knife in the
      meat, sar, that side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the point of the blade Jack prodded the substance of the oyster at
      the point indicated, and presently laid bare the queen of the royal family
      of pearls on which they had stumbled. Larger by far than any of the
      twenty-five already taken from the shell, this latest addition to the
      number was in shape like a pear, in lustre of the purest pale yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him gold pearl, sa'b!&rdquo; cried Puggles gleefully, grinning from ear to ear.
      &ldquo;Other only silver. Gold pearl plenty price fetching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack, old fellow,&rdquo; cried Don, thumping his companion on the back,
      &ldquo;Puggles is right; we're in luck. I've heard the guv say that a golden
      pearl isn't found once in twenty years. The priests are ready to give
      simply any sum you like for a really fine specimen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The native who had concealed himself behind the trunk of the banyan tree,
      leaned eagerly forward. So close was he to the absorbed group that he
      could distinctly hear every word of their conversation. As he listened, an
      avaricious glitter shone in his crafty eyes, and he rubbed his hands
      unctuously together, as though he were rubbing pearls between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you suppose the lot is worth; Don?&rdquo; Jack inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some thousands of pounds, I should say. But the guv will be able to tell
      us. Say, I'd better put them in this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taking out his watch, he drew off the soft chamois leather case, and
      carefully transferred the output of the mammoth oyster from Pugs palm to
      this temporary receptacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; cried Jack, leaping to his feet, &ldquo;let's make for the schooner. The
      sun's set, and besides, I shan't feel easy until the golden 'un is in a
      safer place than a waistcoat pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; assented Don. &ldquo;Point, Pug!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they had disappeared in the crowded bazaar, the shark-charmer emerged
      from behind the tree, and took the road to that part of the beach where
      the boats lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time Don and his companions reached the schooner, the brief
      twilight had deepened into the gray darkness of early night. The pearls
      were at once shown to Captain Leigh, who confirmed his son's estimate of
      their value. It would, he said, run well into four figures, if not into
      five. The golden pearl he pronounced to be of special value.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that it would fetch anything in England,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but wealthy
      natives&mdash;and more especially priests&mdash;stop at nothing to secure
      a pearl like that. I mean that in a double sense, my lads; so you had
      better stow your find away in a safe place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the locker under the cabin clock, accordingly, the chamois leather bag
      with its precious contents was placed. On closing the locker, however, to
      his annoyance Don found the key to be missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall put it in the little locker under the cabin clock,&rdquo; said Don. &ldquo;It
      locks, and there isn't a safer place on board the schooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0005" id="linkimage-0005"> </a>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0031.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrap your handkerchief round the bag, so it won't be noticed if any one
      opens the locker,&rdquo; suggested Jack. &ldquo;It will be safe enough then,
      especially as nobody ever comes here except ourselves and Pug.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But on quitting the cabin, to their amazement they came face to face with
      the shark-charmer! He stood at the very bottom of the companionway, within
      a yard of the cabin door, and directly opposite the clock and locker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; cried Don, advancing upon him angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, sab, nothing!&rdquo; protested the native, dropping a running salvo of
      salaams as he backed up the steps. &ldquo;Me only wanting to see big sa'b.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then be off about your business, or you'll get the whipping you missed
      this morning. Do you hear?&rdquo; And, without further ado, Salambo made for the
      deck, where they saw him disappear over the side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he saw us at the locker, Jack?&rdquo; Don asked uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not. But even if he did he wouldn't be any the wiser. He
      knows nothing about the pearls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True enough,&rdquo; said Don, and so the subject dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cabin clock indicated the hour of ten when they turned in for the
      night. Somehow Don found himself unable to sleep. In spite of every effort
      he could make to the contrary, his thoughts <i>would</i> run on the
      pearls. At last he could stand it no longer. Leaping out of his berth, he
      struck a light and crept noiselessly into the main cabin. The companion
      door stood open to admit the night air, and his candle flared in the
      draught.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll get to sleep, perhaps, if I take a look at them,&rdquo; he said to himself
      as he made his way to the locker.
    </p>
    <p>
      An exclamation of alarm burst from his lips. His hand shook so violently
      that it was with difficulty he could hold the candle. The lid of the
      locker stood wide open!
    </p>
    <p>
      Advancing the light, he peered into the receptacle. It contained nothing.
      Handkerchief, bag, pearls&mdash;all had disappeared!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.&mdash;THE QUEST BEGINS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For a moment the discovery paralysed him, body and mind. Then he turned
      and hurried to Jack's cabin. Jack was snoring. Don shook him fiercely by
      the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wake up! The pearls are gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack was awake and on his feet in a twinkling. &ldquo;You're dreaming, old
      fellow,&rdquo; said he, seeing Don in his night-clothes. &ldquo;You're only half
      awake.&rdquo; Don did not argue the matter. He simply seized Jack by the arm and
      dragged him into the main cabin. There the empty locker placed the truth
      of his assertion beyond dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's to be done?&rdquo; gasped Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us call Pug,&rdquo; suggested Don. &ldquo;He may know something about this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Puggles slept on deck. In two minutes they were by his side, and he was
      stretching his jaws in a mighty yawn. Great was his astonishment when he
      heard of the loss. But he could throw no light on the matter. He had
      neither seen nor heard anything suspicious. As for Puggles himself, he was
      above suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down and let us have another look,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;It's just possible,
      you know, that some one may have been to the locker and accidentally
      dropped or knocked the case out upon the floor. I can't believe it's
      gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just as they reached the bottom of the companion-way, Puggles, who was
      slightly in advance of his master, stopped short, and called their
      attention to an object dangling from the handle of the door. Jack caught
      it up and ran to the table, where the lighted candle stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merely a string of wooden beads,&rdquo; said he, tossing the object on the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A native rosary!&rdquo; cried Don, snatching it up. &ldquo;I've seen this before
      somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sa'b,&rdquo; broke in Puggles, his eyes the size and colour of Spanish onions,
      &ldquo;him shark-charmer rosilly, sa'b!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very same!&rdquo; cried Don. &ldquo;I recollect seeing it round his neck this
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I recollect seeing it there this evening,&rdquo; added Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we bundled him out of the companionway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then how do you account for our finding it on the door-knob, and for its
      being broken as it is now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see? The fellow returned, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Returned? When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After we saw him over the side; he never went ashore. He sneaked back,
      and then made off in a tremendous hurry. The position, not to say the
      condition, in which we found the rosary proves that. Jove! what a pair of
      fools we've been. That rascally shark-charmer has diddled us out of the
      pearls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don stared at his friend open-mouthed, yet unable to utter a single word
      either of assent or doubt, so great was the consternation produced in his
      mind by Jack's daring theory as to the disappearance of the pearls, and
      the consequences which must follow if it held good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may take it to be a dead certainty,&rdquo; resumed Jack, following up his
      idea, &ldquo;that when Salambo actually left the ship, the pearls went with him.
      We made the rascal walk the plank this morning, and he's bound to resent
      that, of course. In fact, the way in which he shook his fist at us when he
      went off in the boat shows that he <i>did</i> resent it. Very well, then,
      there's a readymade motive for you&mdash;revenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; said Don, finding his tongue at last, &ldquo;I'm not
      boggling over the motive: the value of the pearls is enough motive for any
      nigger. What puzzles me is this: How did he know we had them in our
      possession at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that's as plain as the nose on your face,&rdquo; replied Jack; &ldquo;the fellow
      was on shore at the same time we were, was he not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, suppose he saw us buy the shells, watched us open them, and,
      in short, discovered that we had met with a stroke of luck. Then he
      follows us back here&mdash;you saw him yourself, didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Don.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you see this, don't you?&rdquo; dangling the rosary before Don's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do; I'm not blind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what the dickens more do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pearls,&rdquo; said Don, laughing. &ldquo;I'm convinced, old fellow, so no more
      palaver. Our business now is to run the shark-charmer down. What's the
      time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eleven o'clock to the minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what start of us do you think he has got?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was about nine when we caught him sneaking, and we turned in at ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And out again half an hour later. Then the locker must have been rifled
      between ten and halfpast. That would give him, say, forty-five minutes'
      start if we were on his track at this identical moment, which we&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      What was that? I heard a noise overhead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one at the skylight,&rdquo; said Jack in a whisper. &ldquo;S-s-sh! I'll slip on
      deck and see who it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The skylight referred to was situated directly over the cabin table, so
      that, its sash being then raised some six inches to admit the night air,
      it afforded a ready means of eavesdropping. Springing lightly up the cabin
      steps in his stocking feet, Jack took a cautious survey of the deck. The
      awning had been taken in at nightfall, and a full moon shone overhead,
      making the whole deck as light as day. Close beside the skylight, lashed
      against the cabin, stood a water-butt; and bending carelessly over this he
      saw one of the native crew. Calling out sharply, he bade him go forward,
      and the fellow, muttering some half-audible excuse about wanting a drink,
      slunk away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lascar after water; I don't think he was spying,&rdquo; said Jack, diving
      below again. &ldquo;All the same, we'll keep an eye aloft; that rascally Salambo
      may have an accomplice among the crew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely; but as I was saying,&rdquo; resumed Don, in a lower key, &ldquo;the
      thief has had ample time to make himself scarce. Now the thing is&mdash;how
      are we to nab him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are the <i>peons</i>. * Why not get the guv to set them on the
      fellow's track?&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Native attendants; pronounced <i>pewns</i>.&mdash;J..R. H.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there's just the difficulty,&rdquo; said Don, with a despairing gesture.
      &ldquo;They all sleep ashore except one or two; and by the time we woke the
      governor, explained matters to him, and got the fellows started, there'd
      be no end of delay. Besides, the rascal would naturally be on the look-out
      for the <i>peons</i>, and either give them the slip or bribe them to let
      him off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so; whatever's done must be done sharp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I was going to say,&rdquo; continued Don. &ldquo;The schooner, you see,
      sails for Colombo in two or three days' time at the most, and it would put
      the governor to no end of inconvenience to despatch half-a-dozen <i>peons</i>
      on an errand like this just now. Fact is, I doubt if he'd do it at all,
      and we might go whistle for our pearls. No, I've a better plan than that
      to propose. There's no need to trouble the guv at all; we'll go ashore and
      capture the thief ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; cried Jack; &ldquo;I'd like nothing better. When shall we start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At once. There's a bright moon, the fellow has only about an hour's
      start, and with ordinary luck we ought to run him down by daybreak at the
      very&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; said Jack suddenly; &ldquo;there's some one at the skylight again. Wait
      a minute&mdash;I'll soon put an end to his spying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clearing the ladder at a bound, he emerged upon the deck before the
      listener was aware of his approach. The spy was actually bending over the
      open skylight. He was there for no good or friendly purpose&mdash;that was
      evident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not after water this time, anyhow,&rdquo; said Jack, hauling him off the
      cabin with scant ceremony. &ldquo;Didn't I tell you to go forward? You'll obey
      orders next time, perhaps;&rdquo; and drawing off, he felled him to the deck
      with a single blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lascar picked himself up and scuttled forward, muttering curses
      beneath his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Jack quietly, as he rejoined those below, &ldquo;we'll not be
      spied upon again to-night, I fancy. Now, Don, for the rest of your plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's soon told. I propose that we follow the thief at once. The only
      difficulty will be to get on his track.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marster going take me?&rdquo; queried Puggles anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; said Don; &ldquo;we couldn't manage without you, Pug.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Puggles, grinning, &ldquo;me soon putting on track; me knowing
      place Salambo sleeping plenty nights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good; there's something in that,&rdquo; said Don. &ldquo;He is sure to go straight to
      his den on leaving the schooner, though it's hardly likely he'll remain
      there to sleep. Still, he might. 'Twill give us a clue to his whereabouts,
      at all events. And now, Jack, ready's the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No time was to be lost, and quietly and quickly their preparations were
      completed. These were by no means extensive: they fully expected to return
      to the schooner by break of day. A revolver, half-a-dozen rounds of
      ammunition, and a few rupees-disposed in their pockets, they stole
      noiselessly on deck. The night was one of breathless calm, and the watch
      lay stretched upon their backs, snoring away the sultry hours of duty.
      Save our three adventurers, not a living thing was astir; not a sound
      broke the stillness of the night; and high overhead the moon floated in
      ghostly splendour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat, as it chanced, lay on that side of the schooner farthest from
      the shore; and in order to shape their course for the beach it was
      necessary to round the vessel's bows. Puggles held the tiller-ropes, but
      in doing this he miscalculated his distance, and ran the boat full tilt
      against the schooners cable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep her off, Pug!&rdquo; cried his master in suppressed, half-angry tones.
      &ldquo;Can't you see where you're steering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the momentary confusion a figure appeared for a moment above the
      schooner's bulwarks. Then a glittering object hurtled through the moonlit
      air and struck the gun'le of the boat immediately abaft the thwait on
      which Jack sat. Jack uttered a stifled cry and dropped his oar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; said Don impatiently, as the boat swung clear of the
      cable. &ldquo;Pull, old fellow; we've no time to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better lose a little time than one's life,&rdquo; muttered Jack through his set
      teeth. &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning in his seat Don saw, still quivering in the gun'le of the boat
      where its point had stuck, a sailor's heavy sheath-knife. In its passage
      it had slashed open the shoulder of Jack's coat, grazing the flesh so
      closely as to draw blood&mdash;the first shed in the quest of the golden
      pearl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack passed it off with an air of indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mere scratch,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but a close shave all the same. The work of
      that treacherous lascar I knocked down a while back. Saw his ugly
      head-piece above the rail just now, don't you know. There's no time to pay
      him out now, but if ever he interferes with me again he'll get his knife
      back, anyhow!&rdquo; and wrenching the formidable weapon free of the plank, he
      thrust it into his belt and again bent to his oar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that fellow's an accomplice of the shark-charmer, it looks as though
      they meant business,&rdquo; commented Don, seconding his companion's stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So do we, if it comes to that,&rdquo; was Jacks significant retort,
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time they pulled in silence, the creaking of the oars in the
      rowlocks and the soft purling of the water about the boat's prow being the
      only sounds audible. When within a couple of hundred yards of the gleaming
      surfline, Don suddenly broke the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold hard, Jack! Do you make out anything astern there&mdash;anything
      black on the water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Jack, after a moment's hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's gone now, but I saw it quite plainly. Struck me it looked like a
      man's head. Must have been a dugong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or the lascar,&rdquo; suggested Jack. &ldquo;He's safe to follow us if he's an
      accomplice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly safe with so many sharks about,&rdquo; rejoined Don, &ldquo;unless his master
      has provided him with an extra potent charm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later, the boat having meanwhile been beached upon the
      deserted sands, Puggles was rapidly &ldquo;pointing&rdquo; for the bazaar, where the
      shark-charmer slept o' nights. That they should find him there to-night,
      however, was almost too much to hope. He had probably &ldquo;made tracks&rdquo; with
      all speed after securing the pearls. All the same, a visit to the bazaar
      might furnish some clue to his present whereabouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said Don, when within fifty yards of the spot. &ldquo;The whole place
      will be astir in two minutes if we show ourselves, Jack. We'd better send
      Pug on ahead to reconnoitre while we wait here. Do you know the hut he
      usually sleeps in, Pug?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me finding with me eyes shut, sa'b.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Now listen. Make your way to this hut as quietly as you can, and
      ascertain whether he's there or not. If he's there, don't wake him, but
      come back here as fast as your legs can carry you. If he's not there, try
      and find out where he's gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put your cloth over your head so he won't recognise you, and say you've
      come on business,&rdquo; put in Jack. &ldquo;Pretend you want a charm, or something of
      that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bad idea,&rdquo; assented Don. &ldquo;You understand, Pug?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me understanding, sa'b.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then be off with you, sharp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Puggles promptly disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of ten minutes he returned, accompanied by a native muffled
      from head to heel in a blanket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely he can't have induced the old fellow to return with him!&rdquo;
       whispered Jack excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in this surmise he was wrong. It was not the shark-charmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dis one bery nice black man; plenty talk got,&rdquo; said Puggles, by way of
      introduction, when he reached the spot where his master and Jack were
      waiting. &ldquo;Him telling shark-charmer no here; he going one village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as I feared,&rdquo; said Don. &ldquo;How far is it to this village, Pug!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him telling one two legs,&rdquo; replied Puggles, meaning leagues. &ldquo;Village
      'long shore; marster giving one rupee, dis'black man showing way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without further parley the rupee was transferred from Don's pocket to the
      stranger's outstretched palm, and off they started. After following the
      beach for about a mile, their guide turned his back upon the sea and
      struck inland, leading them a tortuous course amid ghostly, interminable
      sand-hills, where the mournful sighing of the night-wind through the tall
      silver-grass, and the howling of predatory jackals, added to the weird
      loneliness of the scene. A blurred furrow in the yielding sand formed the
      only footpath. So slow was their progress that when at last the guide
      pointed out the village a halfmile ahead, Don, on consulting his watch,
      found it to be three o'clock. They had wasted fully two hours in walking
      six miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were still some little distance short of the village, the guide
      stopped, and pointing out a pool of water which shone like a boss of
      polished silver amid the sand-hills, asked leave to go and slake his
      thirst. His request granted, he disappeared amid the dunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Jack, while they were impatiently awaiting his return,
      &ldquo;I fancy I've seen that fellow before, though I can't for the life of me
      recall where.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guide not returning, they at length went in search of him. But Pug's
      &ldquo;bery nice black man&rdquo; was nowhere to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks as if he meant to leave us in the lurch,&rdquo; Jack began, when a shout
      of &ldquo;Him here got, sa'b!&rdquo; from Puggles, brought them back to the footpath
      at a run.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new-comer, however, was not the missing guide, but a stranger. He had
      been belated at the bazaar, he told them, and was now making his way home
      to the village close by. In answer to inquiries concerning the
      shark-charmer, he imparted a startling piece of news.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shark-charmer had indeed taken his departure from the bazaar, but not
      to this village. He had, the stranger asserted, embarked in a coasting
      vessel bound for the opposite side of the Strait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don uttered an exclamation of impatience and dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be safe on the Madras coast by daybreak!&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him there coming from, sa'b,&rdquo; put in Puggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that lying guide,&rdquo; added Jack savagely, &ldquo;was an accomplice, left
      behind to throw us off the scent. Don't you remember you saw some one
      swimming after the boat? I'll lay any odds 'twas the lascar. He got to the
      bazaar ahead of us&mdash;he could easily manage that, you know, by running
      along the sands&mdash;muffled himself up so that I shouldn't recognise
      him, and then led us on this fool's errand while his master made off.
      Well, good-bye to the golden pearl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it!&rdquo; cried Don resolutely. &ldquo;I, for one, shan't relinquish
      the quest, come what may. Back we go to the schooner! Then, with the
      governor's consent, we'll go further. Point, Pug!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack seconding this proposal heartily, they rewarded the communicative
      native, and with unflagging determination retraced their steps. By four
      o'clock they had traversed something more than half the distance. The dawn
      star was now high above the eastern horizon. A rosy flush in the same
      quarter warned them that day was rapidly approaching. Suddenly, out of the
      gray distance ahead, a dull booming sound floated to their ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The schooner's signal gun!&rdquo; exclaimed Don. &ldquo;Why, it's too early yet by a
      good hour for the boats to put out. What's the governor about, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it goes again!&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;I never knew it to be fired twice of a
      morning, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said Don uneasily. &ldquo;Come, let us get on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Off again at their best speed, until at length the heavy path was
      exchanged for the smooth, hard sand of the beach. On this it was possible
      to make better time, and by five o'clock they were within half a mile or
      so of the bazaar. It was now daylight; but a sharp bend in the coast-line,
      and the sand-hills which here rose steeply from the beach on their left,
      as yet concealed both the landing-place and the schooner from view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Puggles, who in spite of his shortness of limb had throughout maintained
      the lead by several rods, suddenly stopped, and fell to shouting and
      gesticulating wildly. Breaking into a run, Don and Jack speedily came up
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, sa'b, look!&rdquo; gasped Puggles, pointing down the coast with shaking
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far away on the horizon appeared the white canvas of a vessel bowling
      along before the fresh land breeze, with a fleet of fishing-boats
      spreading their fustian-hued wings in her wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spot where our adventurers had last seen the schooner at anchor was
      deserted. She was gone!

      sailed!
    </p>
    <p>
      When the dismay caused by this unlooked-for turn of events had somewhat
      abated, Jack, catching sight of the black boy's lugubrious face, fell to
      laughing heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Don, following his chum's example, &ldquo;it's no use crying
      over spilt milk. I'm not sure but this is the best thing that could have
      happened, Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My opinion exactly. We began the quest without the guv's knowledge, and
      <i>nolens volens</i> we must continue it without his consent. What's the
      next piece on the programme, old fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don pondered for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, first,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we must ascertain whether that fellow told us the
      truth about the shark-charmer's having gone across the Strait. If it turns
      out that he has, then I'm not exactly clear yet as to what our next move
      will be, though I've an idea. You shall hear what it is later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Jack &ldquo;whatever course you decide on, I'm with you heart
      and fist, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arrived in the vicinity of the bazaar, Puggles was at once despatched to
      learn what he could of the shark-charmer's movements. In half an hour he
      returned. His report confirmed that which they had already heard. The
      shark-charmer had undoubtedly sailed for the opposite side of the Strait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throwing himself upon his back in the shade of the banyan tree which had
      witnessed the discovery of the pearls, Don drew his helmet over his eyes,
      and pondered long and deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; said he at length, &ldquo;how much money have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack turned out his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barely a rupee and a half,&rdquo; said he,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; added Don, turning out his own, &ldquo;have four and a half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here one rupee got, sa'b,&rdquo; cried Puggles, tugging at his waist-cloth. &ldquo;Me
      giving him heart and fist, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes seven rupees, then,&rdquo; said his master, laughing; &ldquo;not much to
      continue the quest on, eh, Jack?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll manage,&rdquo; said Jack hopefully. &ldquo;But, I say, you haven't told us your
      plans yet, old fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, our course is as plain as a pikestaff. We'll hire a native boat, and
      follow the shark-charmer across the Strait. The only question is, where's
      enough money to come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;unless we try to borrow it in the bazaar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture there occurred an interruption which, unlikely though it
      may seem, was destined to lead to a most satisfactory solution of this
      all-important and perplexing question.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this conversation was in progress Puggles had seated himself at a
      short distance behind his master, and throwing his turban aside, proceeded
      to untie and dress the one tuft of hair which adorned the back of his
      otherwise cleanly shaven head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly above the spot where he sat there extended far out from the trunk
      of the banyan a branch of great size, from which dangled numerous
      rope-like air-roots, which, reaching to-within a few feet of the ground,
      swayed to and fro in the morning breeze. Out along this branch crept a
      large black monkey, which, after taking a cautious survey of Puggles and
      his unconscious neighbours, glided noiselessly down one of the swinging
      roots, and from its extremity dropped lightly to the ground within a yard
      of the discarded turban. Cautiously, with his cunning ferret-eyes fastened
      on the preoccupied Puggles, the monkey approached the coveted prize,
      snatched it up, and with a shrill cry of triumph turned tail and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking quickly round at the cry, Puggles took in the situation at a
      glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sa'b! Sar!&rdquo; he shouted, invoking the aid of both his master and Jack in
      one breath, &ldquo;one black debil monkey me turban done hooking;&rdquo; and leaping
      to his feet he gave chase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;the little beast is making a bee-line for the old fort.
      It must be Bosin, Captain Mango's pet monkey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Mango!&rdquo; cried Don, as though seized with some sudden inspiration.
      &ldquo;Never thought of him until this minute!&rdquo; and, clapping on his helmet, he
      set off at a run after Puggles and the monkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away like the wind went the monkey, the stolen turban trailing after him
      through the sand like a great serpent; and away went Puggles, his back
      hair flying. But while Puggles was short of wind, the monkey was nimble of
      foot. The race was, therefore, unequal from the start, its finish more
      summary than satisfactory; for as Puggles ran, with his eyes glued upon
      the scurrying monkey, and his mouth wide-stretched, his foot unluckily
      came in contact with a tree-root, which lay directly across his path.
      Immediately beyond was a bed of fine soft sand, and into this he pitched,
      head foremost. Just then his master came up, with Jack at his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sa'b! Sar!&rdquo; spluttered Puggles, knuckling his eyes and spitting sand
      right and left, &ldquo;debil monkey done stole turban. Where him going, sa'b?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Pug,&rdquo; his master called out as he ran past; &ldquo;your headgear's all
      right&mdash;the monkey's taken it into the fort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The structure known as &ldquo;the fort&rdquo; occupied the summit of a sandy knoll,
      about which grew a thick plantation of cocoanut palms, seemingly as
      ancient as the fort itself. The walls of the enclosure had so crumbled
      away in places as to afford glimpses of the buildings within. These were
      two in number&mdash;one an ancient <i>godown</i>, as dilapidated as the
      surrounding wall; the other, a bungalow in excellent repair, blazing in
      all the glory of abundant whitewash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards this building, after passing the tumble-down gateway, with its
      turreted side-towers alive with pigeons, Don and his companion shaped
      their course; for this was by no means their first visit to the fort. A
      broad, low-eaved verandah shaded the front of the bungalow, and upon this
      opened two or three low windows and a door. As they drew near a shadow
      suddenly darkened the doorway, and there emerged upon the verandah an
      individual whose pea-jacket and trousers of generous nautical cut
      unmistakably proclaimed him to be a seafaring man. About his throat a
      neckerchief of a deep marine blue was tied in a huge knot; while from
      beneath the left leg of his wide pantaloons there projected the end of a
      stout wooden substitute for the real limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      On catching sight of his visitors an expression of mingled astonishment
      and pleasure overspread his honest, bronzed features.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Shiver my binnacle!&rdquo; roared he, advancing with a series of hitches and
      extended hand to meet them. &ldquo;Shiver my binnacle if it ain't Master Don and
      Master Jack made port again! An' split my topsails, yonder's the little
      nigger swab a-bearin' down under full sail out o' the offin! Lay alongside
      the old hulk, my hearties, an' tell an old shipmate what may be the
      meaning of it all. Where away might the schooner be, I axes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you the truth, Captain Mango,&rdquo; said Don, shaking the old sailor
      by the hand in hearty fashion, &ldquo;on that point we're as much at sea as
      yourself. We pulled ashore last night on a little matter of business of
      our own&mdash;without the skipper's knowledge, you understand&mdash;and
      when we returned here this morning the schooner had sailed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shiver my figger-head if ever I hear'd any yarn to beat that!&rdquo; roared the
      captain, gripping Jack by the hand in turn. &ldquo;An' d'ye mean to say now, as
      ye ain't atween decks, sound asleep in your bunks, when the wessel gets
      under weigh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not we,&rdquo; cried Jack, laughing at the captain's puzzled face and earnest
      manner; &ldquo;we were miles down the coast just then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belay there!&rdquo; sang out the captain, rubbing his stubbly chin in greater
      perplexity than ever. &ldquo;Blow me if I'm able to make out what tack you're
      on, lad. For, d'ye see, I lays alongside o' the wessel somewheres about
      eight bells&mdash;arter they fires the signal gun, d'ye see&mdash;to pay
      my 'specks to the master like, and shiver my bulk-head, when I axes what
      might <i>your</i> bearin's be, lads, he ups an' says, 'The younkers be
      below decks,' says he; an' so he weighs anchor, an' shapes his course for
      Colombie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's plain there's been a double misunderstanding,&rdquo; said Don; &ldquo;<i>we</i>
      knew nothing of the guv's intention to sail this morning, and <i>he</i>
      knew nothing of our absence from the schooner. He, of course, thought we
      were below, and so sailed without us. As I hinted just now, we're ashore
      on business of our own. Fact is, we're in a fix, and we want your advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adwice is it?&rdquo; cried the captain, leading his visitors indoors; &ldquo;fire
      away, lads, till I hears what manner o' stuff you wants, and the wery best
      a water-logged old seaman can give ye, ye shall have&mdash;shiver my
      figger-head if ye shan't! Howsomedever, afore we lays our heads together
      like, I'll pipe the cook and order ye some wittles.&rdquo; This hospitable duty
      performed, the captain threw himself into a chair with his &ldquo;main-brace,&rdquo;
       as he jocosely termed his wooden leg, extended before him, and, bidding
      Don proceed with what he had to say, composed himself to listen. Whereupon
      Don recounted the cause and manner of the shark-charmer's punishment, the
      discovery and subsequent loss of the pearls, together with their reasons
      for suspecting the shark-charmer of the theft, as well as how they had
      been tricked by the latter's supposed accomplice, and on making their way
      back to the beach had found, not the schooner as they expected, but a
      deserted roadstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thief has crossed the Strait, there's no doubt about that,&rdquo; he
      concluded. &ldquo;<i>We</i> want to hire a boat and go in pursuit of him; but
      the governor's sudden departure has placed us in a dilemma. The fact is,
      captain, we haven't enough cash to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belay there!&rdquo; roared the captain, stumping across the room to a
      side-table. &ldquo;Hold hard, lads, till I has a whiff o' the fragrant! Shiver
      my maintop! there's nothing like tobackie for ilin' up a seaman's runnin'
      gear, says you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Filling a meerschaum pipe of high colour and huge dimensions from a pouch
      almost as large as a sailor's bag, the captain reseated himself, and for
      some minutes puffed away in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shiver my smokestack!&rdquo; cried he at last, slapping his thigh energetically
      with his disengaged hand, &ldquo;the thing's as easy as boxin' the compass,
      lads! You axes me for adwice: my adwice is, up anchor and away as soon as
      ye can. Supplies is low, says you. What o' that? I axes. There's a canvas
      bag in the old sea-chest yonder as'll charter all the boats hereabouts, if
      so be as they're wanted, which they ain't, d'ye mind me. Ye can dror on
      the canvas bag, lads, an' welcome&mdash;why not? I axes. An' there's as
      tight a leetle cutter in the boat-house below as ever ye clapped eyes on&mdash;which
      the <i>Jolly Tar's</i> her name&mdash;what's at your sarvice, shiver my
      main-brace if it ain't! An' blow me, as the fog-horn says to the
      donkey-engine, I'll ship along with ye, lads!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;An' a-sailin' we'll go, we'll go;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      An' a-sailin' we will go-o-o!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      he concluded, with a stave of a rollicking old sea-song.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah! You're a trump, captain, and no mistake!&rdquo; cried Jack, while Don
      sprang forward and gripped the old sailor's hand with a heartiness that
      showed how thoroughly he appreciated this generous offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, y'see, lads,&rdquo; explained the captain apologetically, &ldquo;'twould be ekal
      to a-sendin' of ye to Davy Jones if I was to let ye go pokin&rdquo; round this
      'ere Strait alone. Now me&mdash;rope-yarn an' marlin-spikes!&mdash;there
      ain't a reef, nor a shool, nor yet a crik atween Colombie an' Jafna P'int
      but what's laid down on this 'ere old chart o' mine,&rdquo; tapping his forehead
      significantly. &ldquo;An' besides I'm a-spilin' for a bit o' the briny, so with
      you I ships&mdash;an' why not? I axes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And right glad of your company and assistance we'll be, captain,&rdquo; said
      Don. &ldquo;The main difficulty will be, of course, to discover to what part of
      the Indian coast the thief has gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain puffed thoughtfully at his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, as for that,&rdquo; said he at length, &ldquo;I've an idee as I knows his
      reckonin', shiver my binnacle if I ain't! But that's neither here nor
      there at this present speakin'. Ballast's the first consideration, lads;
      so dror up your cheers an' tackle the perwisions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they had complied with this welcome invitation to the entire
      satisfaction of the captain and their own appetites, &ldquo;Now, lads,&rdquo; said the
      old sailor gaily, &ldquo;do ye turn in an' snatch a wink o' sleep, whiles I goes
      an' gets the cutter ready for puttin' to sea. For, says you, look alive's
      the word if so be as we wants to overhaul the warmint as took the treasure
      in tow. Spike my guns!&mdash;we'll make him heave to in no time!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;For all things is ready, an' nothing we want,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To fit out our ship as rides so close by;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Both wittles an' weapons, they be nothing scant,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Like worthy sea-dogs ourselves we will try!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Trolling this ditty, the captain stumped away, while his guests made
      themselves as comfortable as they could, and sought the slumber of which
      they stood so much in need.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late in the afternoon when they woke. Puggles had disappeared.
      Proceeding to the beach, they found the captain, assisted by a small army
      of native servants, busily engaged in putting the-finishing touches to his
      preparations for the proposed voyage. Just above the surf-line lay the <i>Jolly
      Tar</i>&mdash;a trim little craft, fitted with mast-and sprit, whose
      sharp, clean-cut lines betokened possibilities in the way of speed that
      promised well for the issue of their enterprise. In the cuddy, amid a
      bewildering array of pots, pans, and pannkins, Puggles had already
      installed himself, his shining face a perfect picture of self-complacent
      good-nature, whilst Bosin, newly released from durance vile, sat in the
      stern-sheets, cracking nuts-and jabbering defiance at his black rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A purty craft!&rdquo; chuckled the captain, checking for a moment the song that
      was always on his lips, as he led his visitors to the cutters side; &ldquo;stave
      my water-butt if there's anything can pull ahead of her in these 'ere
      parts. Everything shipshape 'an' ready to hand, d'ye see&mdash;wittles for
      the woyage, an' drink for the woyagers. Likewise ammunitions o' war,&rdquo;
       cried he proudly, pointing out a number of muskets and shining cutlasses,
      which a servant just then brought up and placed on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Bath, wittles an' weapons, they be nothing scant,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So like worthy sea-dogs ourselves we will try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What with the cutlasses and guns, and the captain's wooden leg, to say
      nothing of our small-arms, Don,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;we'd better set up for
      buccaneers at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shiver my main-brace! a wooden leg ain't sich a bad article arter all,&rdquo;
       rejoined the captain; &ldquo;specially when a seaman falls overboard. With a
      life-buoy o' that nater rove on to his starn-sheets, he's sartin to keep
      one leg above water, says you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt of that, even if he goes down by the head,&rdquo; assented Don,
      laughing. &ldquo;But, I say, captain, what's in the keg&mdash;spirits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Avast there!&rdquo; replied the captain, half shutting one eye and
      contemplating the keg with the other, &ldquo;that 'ere keg, lads, has stuff in
      its hold what's a sight better'n spurts. Gunpowder, lads, that's what it
      is; and spike my guns if we don't broach the same to the health of old
      Salambo when we falls in with him. What say you, lads?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;We always be ready,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Steady, lads, steady;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We'll fight an' we'll conquer agin an' agin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope we shan't have to do that, captain,&rdquo; said Jack gravely. &ldquo;But
      powder or no powder, we'll pay the beggar out, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, lad; so we'll just take the keg along with us in case of
      emargencies like. Shiver my compass, there's no telling aforehand what
      this 'ere wenture may lead to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To whatever the venture was destined to lead, preparations for its
      successful inception went on apace, and by nightfall all was in readiness.
      The captain declaring that he &ldquo;couldn't abide the ways o' them 'ere
      jabbering nigger swabs when afloat,&rdquo; the only addition to their numbers
      was a single trusty servant of the old sailor's, who was taken along
      rather with a view to the cutter's safety when they should be ashore than
      because his assistance was required in sailing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don having despatched an overland messenger with a letter to his father,
      explaining their absence and proposed undertaking, as the full moon rose
      out of the eastern sea the cutter was launched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later, with her white sails bellying before the freshening
      land-breeze, she bore away for the opposite shore of the Strait, on that
      quest from which one at least of those on board was destined never to
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      While her sails were yet visible in the moonlit offing, a native crept
      down to the deserted beach. He was a dark-skinned, evil-featured fellow;
      and the moonlight, falling upon his face, showed his left temple to be
      swollen and discoloured as from a recent blow. On his shoulder he carried
      a paddle-and a boathook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wind will drop just before dawn,&rdquo; he muttered, as he stood a moment
      noting the strength and direction of the breeze. &ldquo;Then, you white-devil,
      then!&rdquo; and he patted the boathook affectionately, as if between him and it
      there existed some secret, dark understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Selecting a <i>ballam</i> or &ldquo;dug-out&rdquo; from amongst a number that lay
      there, he placed the boathook carefully in the bottom of the frail skiff,
      and launched it almost in the furrow which the cutter's keel had ploughed
      in the yielding sand. Then springing in, and plying his paddle with rapid
      strokes, he quickly disappeared in the cutter's wake.

      CHAPTER V.&mdash;THE LASCAR GETS HIS KNIFE BACK.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>er light sails
      winged to catch every breath of the light but steady breeze that chased
      her astern, the cutter for some hours bowled through the water merrily. In
      the cabin Puggles and the captain's Black servant snored side by side;
      whilst Don and Jack lolled comfortably just abaft the mast-, where the
      night wind, soft and spicy as the breath of Eden, would speedily have
      lulled them to slumber but for the excitement that fired their blood. The
      Captain was at the tiller, Bosin curled up by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this 'ere wind holds, lads,&rdquo; exclaimed the old sailor abruptly, after
      a prolonged silence on his part, &ldquo;we'd orter make the island agin sunrise,
      shiver my forefoot if we don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don looked up with half-sleepy interest. &ldquo;Island, captain? I thought we
      were heading straight for the Indian coast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, so we be, straight away. But, y'see, lad, as I hinted a while back, I
      has a sort o' innard idee, so to say, as the old woman ain't on the
      mainland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What old woman?&rdquo; queried Jack, yawning. &ldquo;Didn't know there was one in the
      case, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old sailor burst into a roar of laughter. &ldquo;An' no more there ain't,
      lad,&rdquo; chuckled he; &ldquo;an' slit my hammock if we wants one, says you. Forty
      odd year has I sailed the seas, an' hain't signed articles with any on 'em
      yet. A tight leetle wessel's the lass for me, lads; for, unship my helm!
      <i>she</i> never takes her own head for it, says you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what about the old woman you mentioned captain?&rdquo; said Don
      banteringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Avast there now! An' d'ye mean to say,&rdquo; demanded the captain
      incredulously, &ldquo;as you ain't ever hear'd tell o' the fish what sails under
      that 'ere name? And a wicious warmint he is, too, shiver my keelson!
      Hysters is his wittles, an' pearls his physic; he lives on 'em, so to say;
      an' so I calls the cove as took them pearls o' your'n in tow an old woman;
      an' why not, I axes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about the island you spoke of just now, captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, d'ye see, it's this way, lads; there's an island off the coast
      ahead, a sort o' holy place like, where them thievin' natives goes once a
      year an' gets salwation from their sins. Howsomedever, that's neither here
      nor there, says you; the p'int's this, lads: Somewheres about the month o'
      March, which is this same month, says you, here the priests flocks from
      all parts, an' here they stays until they gets a purty pocketful o' cash.
      Now, my idee's this, d'ye see: the old woman&mdash;which I means Salambo&mdash;lays
      alongside the schooner an' takes them pearls o' your'n in tow. What for?
      says you. Cash, says I. An' so, shiver my main-brace, he shapes his course
      for this 'ere island, an' sells 'em to the priests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; assented Don. &ldquo;He's bound to carry them to the best market,
      of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And equally of course the best market is where the most priests are. By
      Jove, you <i>have</i> a headpiece, captain!&rdquo; put in Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid, though,&rdquo; resumed Don, after a moment's silence, &ldquo;I'm afraid
      it's not going to be so easy to come at the old fellow as we think. You
      say this island's a sort of holy place; well, it's bound to be packed with
      natives to the very surf-line in that case. Rather ticklish work, I should
      think, taking the old fellow among so many pals. There's the getting
      ashore, too; what's to prevent their sighting us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belay there!&rdquo; roared the captain, vigorously thumping the bottom of the
      boat with his wooden leg. &ldquo;Shiver my main-brace! what sort o' craft do ye
      take me for, I axes? A island's a island the world over&mdash;a lump o'
      land what's floated out to sea. Wery good, that bein' so&mdash;painters
      an' boathooks!&mdash;ain't it as easy a-boardin' of her through the
      starn-ports as along o' the forechains?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mean to make the back of the island, and steal a march on old
      Salambo from the rear, then?&rdquo; cried Don. &ldquo;A capital idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're on the right tack there, lad,&rdquo; assented the captain. &ldquo;There's as
      purty a leetle cove at the backside o' that island as ever wessel cast
      anchor in, an' well I knows it, shiver my binnacle! Daylight orter put us
      into it, if so be&mdash;&mdash; Split my sprit-sail, lads, if it ain't
      a-fallin' calm!&rdquo;
     </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      An ominous flapping of the cutter's sails confirmed the captain's words.
      During the half-hour over which this conversation extended the wind had
      gradually died away until scarcely a movement of the warm night air could
      be felt. The cutter, losing her headway, rolled lazily to the motion of
      the long, glassy swell. Consulting his watch, Don announced it to be three
      o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This 'ere's the lull at ween the sea-breeze an' the land-breeze,&rdquo;
       observed the captain complacently, working the tiller from side to side as
      if trying to coax renewed life into the cutter. &ldquo;How-somedever, it hadn't
      orter last long. Stow my sea-chest!&mdash;we'll turn in an' catch a wink
      o' sleep atween whiles. Here, Master Jack, lad! take a turn at the tiller,
      will 'ee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Settling himself in the captain's place, with instructions to call that
      worthy sea-dog should the wind freshen, Jack began his first watch.
      Becalmed as they were, the tiller was useless, so he let it swing,
      contenting himself with keeping a bright look-out. But soon he concluded
      even this to be an unnecessary precaution. Not a sail was to be seen on
      the moonlit expanse of ocean; and even had a score been in sight, there
      would still have been no danger whatever, in the absence of wind, of their
      interfering with the cutter. In fine, so secure did he consider their
      position, and so soporific an influence did the comfortable snoring of Don
      and the captain exercise upon him, that in a very short time his head sank
      upon his breast, and he fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had slept soundly for perhaps an hour, when a cold, touch upon the
      cheek startled him into consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rousing himself, he found Bosin at his elbow. The monkey for some reason
      had left his masters side, and it was his clammy paw, Jack now perceived,
      that had awakened him. It almost looked as if the monkey had purposely
      interrupted his slumber. But what had roused the monkey? Jack rose to his
      feet, stretched himself, and looked about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was, if anything, more breathlessly calm than when he had
      relieved the captain. Upon the unruffled, deserted sea the moonlight
      shimmered with a brilliancy uncanny in its ghostliness. From the cutter
      straight away to and around the horizon not an object, so far as he could
      make out, darkened the surface of the water, except under the cutter's
      larboard bow, where the moon-cast shadow of the sail fell. He fancied he
      saw something move there, close under the bow where the shadow lay
      blackest. The next instant it had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Bosin, old chap,&rdquo; said he, stroking the monkeys back; &ldquo;a false
      alarm this time&mdash;back to your quarters, old fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The monkey, as if reassured by these words, crept away to his master's
      side, whilst Jack resumed his seat, and again dozed off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not for long, however. It was not the monkey this time, but a sudden and
      by no means gentle thud against the cutters side that roused him. Awake in
      an instant, he sprang to his feet with a startled exclamation. Close under
      the cutter's quarter lay a canoe, and in the canoe there stood erect a
      native, with what appeared to be a boathook poised above his head. All
      this Jack took in at a glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boat ahoy! Who's that?&rdquo; he cried sharply, his hand instinctively seeking
      the knife at his belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer came a savage, muttered imprecation; and the boathook, impelled
      with all the strength of the native's muscular arms, descended swiftly
      through the air. Starting aside, Jack received the blow' upon his left
      arm, off which the heavy, iron-shod weapon glanced, striking the gun'le of
      the boat with a resounding crash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lascar!&rdquo; muttered Jack between his teeth, as he stepped back a pace
      and whipped out his knife in anticipation of a renewal of the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the lascar, baffled in his attempt to take his enemy by surprise, did
      not repeat the blow. Instead, he drew off, and with all his strength drove
      the iron point of the boathook through the cutter's side below the
      water-line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven!&rdquo; cried Jack, as he perceived his intention, &ldquo;I'll soon settle
      scores with you, my fine fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Springing lightly upon the gunle, at a single bound he cleared the few
      yards of open water intervening between the cutter and the canoe, and with
      all the impetus of his leap drove the knife into the lascar's shoulder up
      to the very hilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lascar went overboard like a log. The canoe overturning at the same
      instant, Jack followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise of the scuffle having roused the sleepers, all was now wild
      commotion on board the cutter; Captain Mango roaring out his strange
      nautical oaths, and stumping hither and thither in search of something
      with which to stop the leak; Don shouting wildly at Jack, as he hastily
      threw off shoes and coat to swim to his assistance. Before either well
      knew what had actually happened, Jack was alongside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter? Are you hurt?&rdquo; Don inquired anxiously, giving him a
      hand over the side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurt? No, not a scratch,&rdquo; said Jack lightly, scrambling inboard, and
      proceeding to wring the water from his dripping garments. &ldquo;A narrow
      squeak, though. That lascar villain has got his knife back, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; cried Don in amazement; for, amid the confusion, neither he nor the
      captain had seen the native.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lascar. What else do you suppose I went over the side for? I dozed
      off, you see, captain,&rdquo; said Jack, as the old sailor came stumping up with
      extended hand, &ldquo;and that lascar dog, who must have seen us sail and
      paddled after us, stole a march on me, and tried to crack my nut with a
      boathook. Lucky for me, he ran his canoe against the side and woke me up.
      Got on my feet just in time to dodge the blow. Then he smashed the
      boathook through the side. By Jove! I forgot that. We must stop the leak,
      or we'll fill in no time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stave my quarter!&rdquo; roared the captain, detaining him as he was about to
      rush aft. &ldquo;The leak's stopped, lad; but blow me if ever I hear'd anything
      to beat this 'ere yarn o' your'n, so spin us the rest on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's soon done,&rdquo; resumed Jack. &ldquo;When I found the fellow wouldn't give
      me a fair show, I boarded him, captain, and treated him to a few inches of
      cold steel. He won't trouble us again, I reckon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had he finished speaking when Don gripped his arm and pointed to
      where, a dozen yards away, the bottom of the canoe glistened in the
      moonlight. A dark object had suddenly appeared alongside the overturned
      skiff. Presently a surging splash was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shiver my keelson if he ain't righted the craft!&rdquo; roared the captain,
      snatching up one of the muskets as the lascar was seen to scramble into
      the canoe and paddle slowly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don laid a quick hand upon the old sailor's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the beggar go,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;He'll never reach land with that knife in
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe not, lad,&rdquo; replied the captain, shaking off the hold upon his arm
      and taking the best aim he could, considering the motion of the boat.
      &ldquo;Bloodshed's best awoided, says you. Wery good; all' the best way to awoid
      it, d'ye mind me, is to send yon warmint to Davy Jones straight away.
      Consequential, the quality o' marcy shan't be strained on this 'ere
      occasion, as the whale says when he swallied the school o' codlings.&rdquo; And
      with that he fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lascar was seen to discontinue the use of his paddle for a moment, and
      then to make off faster than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old sailor's face fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spike my guns, I've gone and missed the warmint!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Howsomedever,
      we'll meet again, as the shark's lower jaw says to the upper 'un when they
      parted company to accomidate the sailor. An' blow me, lads, here comes the
      wind!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Ay, here's a master excelleth in skill,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      An' the master's mate he is not to seek;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An' here's a Bjsin ull do our good will,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      An' a ship, d'ye see, lads, as never had leak.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      So lustily, lustily, let us sail forth!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Our sails he right trim an' the wind's to the north!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now five o'clock, and as day broke the cutter, with a freshening
      breeze on her starboard quarter, bore away for the island, now in full
      view. When about a mile short of it, however, the captain laid the boat's
      head several points nearer the wind, and shaped his course as though
      running past it for the mainland, which lay like a low bank of mist on the
      horizon. In the cuddy Puggles was busy with preparations for breakfast,
      whilst Don lolled on the rail, watching the shore, and idly trailing one
      hand in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo! what's this?&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly, examining with interest a
      fragment of dripping cloth that had caught on his hand. &ldquo;Jack, come here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack happened to be forward just then, hanging out his drenched clothes to
      dry upon an improvised line, but hearing Don's exclamation, he sprang aft.
      Somehow he was always expecting surprises now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Don, rapidly spreading out the soaked cloth upon his
      knee, &ldquo;have you ever seen this before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not likely!&mdash;a mere scrap of rag that some greasy native&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       Jack began, eyeing the said scrap of rag contemptuously. But suddenly his
      tone changed, and he gasped out: &ldquo;By Jove, old fellow, it's not the
      handkerchief, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very same!&rdquo; replied-Don, rising and hurrying aft to where the captain
      stood at the tiller. &ldquo;I say, captain, you remember my telling you how I
      tied a handkerchief round that bag of pearls? Well, here's the identical
      'wipe.' with my initials on it as large as life. Just fished it out of the
      water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For full a minute the old sailor stared at him open-mouthed. Then: &ldquo;Flush
      my scuppers,&rdquo; roared he, &ldquo;if this 'ere ain't the tidiest piece o' luck as
      ever I run agin. We've got the warmint safe in the maintop, so to say,
      where he can't run away&mdash;shiver my main-brace if we ain't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks to your clear head, captain,&rdquo; said Don. &ldquo;It certainly does look as
      if he had come straight to the island here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll purty soon know for sartin; we're a-makin' port hand over fist,&rdquo;
       rejoined the captain, bringing the cutter's head round, and running under
      the lee of the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      This side, unlike the wind-swept seaward face, was thickly clad in jungle,
      above which at intervals towered a solitary palm like a sentinel on duty.
      No traces of human habitation were to be seen; for a rocky backbone or
      ridge, running lengthwise of the island, isolated its frequented portion
      from this jungly half. Midway between the extremities of this ridge rose
      two hills: one a symmetrical, cone-shaped elevation, clad in a mantle of
      jungle green; the other a vast mass of naked rock, towering hundreds of
      feet in air, and in its general-outline somewhat resembling a colossal
      kneeling elephant. As if to heighten the resemblance, there was perched
      upon the lofty back a native temple, which looked for all the world like a
      gigantic howdah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;D'ye see them elewations, lads?&rdquo; cried the captain, heading the cutter
      straight for what-appeared to be an unbroken line of jungle. &ldquo;A. brace o'
      twins, says you. Wery good; atween 'em lies as purty a leetle cove as
      wessel ever cast anchor in&mdash;slip my cable if it ain't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure you're not out of your reckoning, captain?&rdquo; said Jack,
      scanning the shore-line with dubious eye. &ldquo;It's no thoroughfare, so far as
      I can see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Avast there! What d'ye say to that, now?&rdquo; chuckled the captain, as the
      cutter, in obedience to a movement of the tiller, swept round a tiny eyot
      indistinguishable in its mantle of green from, the shore itself, and
      entered a narrow, land-locked creek, whose precipitous sides were
      completely covered from summit to water-line with a rank growth of
      vegetation. &ldquo;Out with the oars, lads! a steam-whistle couldn't coax a wind
      into the likes o' this place, says you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The oars run out, they pulled for some distance through this remarkable
      rift in the hills, the cutter's mast in places sweeping the overhanging
      jungle; until at last a spot was reached where a side ravine cleft the
      cliff upon their left, terminating at the water's edge in a strip of sandy
      beach, thickly shaded with cocoa-nut palms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stow my cargo!&rdquo; chuckled the captain, as he ran the cutter bow-on into
      the sand, &ldquo;a nautical sea-sarpent himself couldn't smell us out here, says
      you. So here we heaves to, and here we lies until&mdash;&mdash;swabs an'
      slush-buckets, what's this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the captain had already scrambled ashore, and as he uttered these
      words he stooped and intently examined the sand at his feet. In it were
      visible recent footprints, and a long trailing furrow that started from
      the water's edge and ran for several yards straight up the beach. Where
      the furrow terminated there lay a native <i>ballam</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack was first to espy the canoe. Guessing the cause of the captain's
      sudden excitement, he ran up the sands to the spot where the rude vessel
      lay. The <i>ballam</i> was still dripping sea-water; and in it, amid a
      pool of blood, lay a sailors sheath-knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lascar!&rdquo; he shouted, snatching up the blood-stained weapon, and
      holding it out at arms length, as Don and the captain hurried up; &ldquo;we've
      landed in his very tracks!&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>ither the lascar's
      wound had not proved as serious as Jack surmised, or the fellow was
      endowed with as many lives as a cat. At all events, he had reached land
      before them, and in safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sharks an' sea-sarpents!&rdquo; fumed the captain, Stumping excitedly round and
      round the canoe. &ldquo;The warmint had orter been sent to Davy Jones as I ad
      wised. Howsomedever, bloodshed's best awoided, says you, Master Don, lad;
      an' so, shiver my keelson! here we lies stranded. What's the course to be
      steered now, I axes? That's a matter o' argyment, says you; so here's for
      a whiff o' the fragrant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bidding his servant fetch pipe and tobacco, the captain seated himself
      upon the canoe and fell to puffing meditatively, his companions meanwhile
      discussing the situation and a project of their own, with many anxious
      glances in the direction of the adjacent jungle, where, for anything they
      knew to the contrary, the lascar might even then be stealthily watching
      their movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shiver my smokestack! d'ye see that, now?&rdquo; exclaimed the captain at last,
      following with half-closed eye and tarry finger the ascent of a perfect
      smoke-ring that had just left his lips. &ldquo;An' what's a ring o' tobackie
      smoke? says you. A forep'intin' to ewents to come, says I. A ring means
      surrounded, d'ye see; an'&mdash;grape-shot an' gun-swabs!&mdash;surrounded
      means fightin', lads!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fun or fighting, I'm ready, anyhow!&rdquo; cried Jack, flourishing his knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, lad; an' me, too, for the matter o' that,&rdquo; replied the old
      sailor, presenting his pipe at an imaginary foe like a pistol; &ldquo;but when
      our situation an' forces is beknownst to the enemy, we're sartin to be
      surprised, d'ye mind me. An' so I gets an idee!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Go palter to lubbers an' swabs, d'ye see?
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      'Bout danger, an' fear, an' the like;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      A tight leetle boat an' good sea-room give me,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      An' it ain't to a leetle I'll strike!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out with the idea then, captain!&rdquo; cried Don.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shiver my cutlass, lads!&mdash;we must carry the war into the camp o' the
      enemy, dye see'. Wery good, that bein' so, what we wants, d'ye mind me, is
      a safe, tidy place to fall back on, as can't be took, or looted, or burnt,
      like the cutter here, whiles we're away on the rampage, so to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not entrench ourselves on the hill just above?&rdquo; suggested Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stow my sea-chest!&mdash;the wery identical plan I perposes,&rdquo; promptly
      replied the captain. &ldquo;An' why? you naterally axes. Because it's ha'nted,
      says I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it's what?&rdquo; cried the two young men in chorus. &ldquo;Haunted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, the abode o' spurts,&rdquo; continued the captain. &ldquo;There's a old ancient
      temple aloft on yon hill, d'ye see, as they calls the 'Ha'nted Pagodas'&mdash;which
      they say as it's a tiger-witch or summat inhabits it, d'ye see&mdash;an'
      shiver my binnacle if a native'll go a-nigh it day or night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirable! But what about the cutter, captain?&rdquo; said Don.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain sucked for a moment at his pipe as if seeking to draw a
      suitable idea therefrom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What o' the cutter? you axes,&rdquo; said he presently. &ldquo;Why, we'll wrarp her
      down the crik a bit, d'ye see, an' stow her away out o' sight where the
      wegitation's thickish-like on the face o' the cliff; copper my bottom if
      we won't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The stores, of course, must be carried up the hill,&rdquo; said Jack, entering
      readily into the captain's plans. &ldquo;We should set about the job at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Avast there, lad! What's to perwent the jungle hereabouts a-usin' of its
      eyes? I axes. The wail o' night, says you. So, when the wail o' night
      unfurls, as the poic says, why, up the hill they goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This being unanimously agreed to, and Puggles at that moment announcing
      breakfast, our trio of adventurers adjourned to the cutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said Don, after delighting the black boy's heart by a ravenous
      attack upon the eatables, &ldquo;like you, I've got an idee&mdash;Hullo, you,
      Pug! What are you grinning at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nutting, sa'b,&rdquo; replied Puggles, clapping his hand over his mouth; &ldquo;only
      when marster plenty eating, he sometimes bery often one idee getting.
      Plenty food go inside, he kicking idee out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just double reef those lips of yours, Pug, and tell us where do <i>your</i>
      ideas come from?&rdquo; said Jack, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me tinking him here got, sar,&rdquo; said Puggles, gravely patting his
      waistband, at which the old sailor nearly choked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a pretty stock of them you have, too, judging by the size of your
      apple-cart!&rdquo; said his master, shying a biscuit at his head. &ldquo;Well, as I
      was saying, captain, I have an idea&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flush my scuppers!&rdquo; gasped the old sailor, swallowing a brimming pannikin
      of coffee to clear his throat. &ldquo;Let's hear more on it then, lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's this. Jack and I are going over to the town&mdash;where the
      temples are, you understand&mdash;to see if we can't sight old Salambo. A
      bit of reconnoitring may be of use to us later, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-goin'&mdash;over&mdash;to&mdash;the&mdash;town!&rdquo; roared the captain in
      amazement, separating the words as though each were a reluctant step in
      the direction proposed. &ldquo;Scuttle my cutter, lads! ye'll have the whole
      pack o' waimints down on ye in a brace o' shakes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't say so when you see us in full war-paint,&rdquo; retorted Jack, as he
      and Don rose and disappeared in the cuddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of half an hour the cuddy door was thrown open, and two
      stalwart young natives, in full country dress, confronted the old sailor.
      With the assistance of Puggles and the captain's &ldquo;boy,&rdquo; not to mention
      soot from the cuddy pots, the two young fellows had cleverly &ldquo;made up&rdquo; in
      the guise of Indian pilgrims. At first sight of them, the captain,
      thinking old Salambo's crew were upon him, seized a musket and threw
      himself into an attitude of defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blow me!&rdquo; he roared, when a loud burst of laughter apprised him of his
      mistake, &ldquo;if this ain't the purtiest go as ever I see. Scrapers an'
      holystones, ye might lay alongside the old woman himself, lads, an' him
      not know ye from a reglar, genewine brace o' lying niggers. What tack are
      ye on now, lads? I axes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off to the town, captain,&rdquo; replied Don, &ldquo;to search for old Salambo among
      his idols. That is, if you'll let Spottie here come with us as pilot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spottie&rdquo; was the nickname with which they had dubbed the captain's black
      servant, whose face was deeply pitted from smallpox.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, lads; he's been here afore, an' knows the lay o' the land; so take
      him in tow, and welcome,&rdquo; was the captain's hearty rejoinder. &ldquo;An' stow
      your knives away amidships, in case of emargency like; though blow me if
      they ever take ye for aught but genewine lying niggers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Concealing their knives about their persons in accordance with this
      advice, they launched the lascar's <i>ballam</i> upon the creek&mdash;which
      the captain assured them expanded a little further inland into a broad
      lagoon, too deep to ford&mdash;and so set out.. The paddle had been
      removed; but as the creek appeared to have nowhere, in its upper reaches
      at any rate, a greater depth than half-a-dozen feet, the boathook served
      admirably as, a substitute for propelling the canoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the line for, Spottie?&rdquo; Jack asked, seeing their guide throw a
      coil of small rope into the canoe, which he afterwards boarded in person
      and shoved off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turkle, sar,&rdquo; replied Spottie. &ldquo;Plenty time me catching big turkle asleep
      on sand. He no come in <i>ballam</i>, so me taking rope to tow him astern.
      Him bery nice soup making, sar,&rdquo; said Spottie, who had always an eye to
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little as they guessed it then, this line was to play a more unique and
      serviceable part in the day's adventures than that indicated by the
      soup-loving Spottie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The creek, as the captain had intimated, presently expanded into a lagoon
      fully a quarter of a mile wide, and so shallow in parts that the canoe
      almost touched the amber-coloured sands over which it passed. Arrived at
      the further side, they drew the canoe upon the beach, and continued their
      route to the town by way of a steep jungle-path, which, in the course of
      some fifteen minutes' hard climbing, led them to the crest of the rocky
      ridge. Here they paused a moment to look about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the left lay Haunted Pagoda Hill; on their right the colossal Elephant
      Rock; and, nestling at its base, the native town, with its sea of dun
      roofs and gleaming white temples. The stirring ramp of tom-toms, and the
      hoarse roar of the multitude, floated up to them as they stood
      contemplating the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for it!&rdquo; cried Jack, heading the descent. &ldquo;We'll soon be in the thick
      of it, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes more and they stood on the outskirts of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make for the chief temple, Spottie,&rdquo; said Don to their guide; &ldquo;and
      whatever you do, don't call us sahib or sir. We're only pilgrims like
      yourself, you understand. And say, Spottie, do you know old Salambo, the
      shark-charmer, when you see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By a nod Spottie intimated that he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! He's the chap we're after, you understand. Keep a sharp look-out,
      and if you happen to get your eye on him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or on a lascar with a knife-wound in his shoulder,&rdquo; put in Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just pull my cloth, will you?&rdquo; concluded Don.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the trusty Spottie nodded, and at a signal led the way into the
      main-street, where they immediately found themselves in the midst of a
      noisy, surging crowd of natives.
    </p>
    <p>
      So perfect was their disguise, however, that Don could not detect a single
      suspicious glance directed towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The natives who thronged the street were, to a man, heading for the
      temples. Into these, if nothing was seen of the shark-charmer outside, Don
      was resolved to penetrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      As no English foot is ever allowed&mdash;in Southern India, at least&mdash;to
      cross the threshold of a Hindu shrine, this was a step attended with
      tremendous risk. Detection would mean fighting for their lives against
      overwhelming odds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll do it, however,&rdquo; said Don resolutely. &ldquo;The temple's the place to
      look for him, since he's a priest, and in this disguise the pearls are
      worth the risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That this was also Jack's opinion was plain from the resolute, nonchalant
      manner in which he pressed forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owing to the congested state of the thoroughfare, progress was necessarily
      slow. They were more than an hour in gaining the open <i>maidan</i> in
      which the street terminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the centre of this open space lay a sacred tank, flanked, on that side
      nearest the Elephant Rock, by a vast semicircle of temples. Midway in this
      line stood the chief temple. Here, if at all, the shark-charmer would most
      likely be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to reach the chief temple was no easy task. Vast crowds of pilgrims
      surrounded the sacred tank, awaiting their turn to bathe in its stagnant
      green waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, after much elbowing and pushing, they reached the steps of the
      chief temple. Thus far they had seen nothing of Salambo. As they had
      already made the entire circuit of the tank, there was nothing for it but
      to seek him in the sacred edifice itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spottie led the way, since for him there was absolutely no risk. Following
      close upon his heels, past the hideous stone monsters which flanked the
      entrance, the mock pilgrims found themselves in the temple court. Here the
      crush was even greater than without.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had now reached the crucial point of their adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      A single unguarded word or action on their part, and each man of these
      teeming thousands would instantly become a mortal enemy!
    </p>
    <p>
      Don strove to appear unconcerned, but his pulses throbbed madly at the
      mere thought of detection. As for Jack, the careless poise of his right
      hand at his belt showed him to be on his guard, though he looked as cool
      as a sea-breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the heads of the multitude, on the opposite side of the court, could
      be seen an inner shrine, where offerings were being made. Selecting this
      as his goal, Don began to edge his way slowly but steadily towards it,
      closely followed by Spottie and the undaunted Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he felt a hand tugging at his cloth. Unable to turn himself about
      in the crush, he twisted his head round and caught Spottie's eye. By a
      quick, almost imperceptible movement of hand and head, the black directed
      his attention towards the left. Looking in the direction thus indicated,
      Don saw, but a few yards away, the portly person of the shark-charmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      By dint of persistent pushing, he presently succeeded in approaching so
      near to his man that, had he so wished, he could have laid a hand upon his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shark-charmer was evidently bent upon gaining the inner shrine at the
      opposite side of the court. Inch by inch he pummelled his way through the
      dense crowd, unconscious that the sahibs whom he had robbed were dogging
      his steps. Once when he turned his head his eyes actually rested upon
      Don's face. But he failed to recognise him, and so went on again, greatly
      to Don's relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then of a sudden the limit of the crush was reached, and they emerged upon
      a comparatively clear space immediately in front of the shrine. This the
      shark-charmer crossed without hesitation, but Don hung back, uncertain
      whether it would be prudent to venture further. However, seeing a group of
      natives about to approach the shrine with offerings, he joined them, and
      in company with Jack ascended the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shark-charmer had already disappeared within.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fumbling in his cloth for some small coin, to present as an offering, Don
      crossed the threshold, and was in the very act of penetrating the dimly
      lighted, incense-clouded chamber just beyond, when a guarded exclamation
      from Jack caused him to glance quickly over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following them with the stealthy tread of a panther was a swarthy,
      evil-looking native.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lascar!&rdquo; said Jack, in a low, breathless whisper. &ldquo;Back, old fellow,
      for your life! Once in the crowd, we're safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0009" id="linkimage-0009"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0099.jpg" alt="0099 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0099.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Back they darted towards the entrance, but the lascar, anticipating this
      manouvre, was on his guard. As Jack dashed past, the cunning spy thrust
      out his foot and sent him sprawling on the flagstones. Don, hearing the
      noise, turned back to his friend's assistance, and by the time Jack
      regained his feet the lascar had reached the entrance mid raised the
      hue-and-cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way!&rdquo; cried Don, making for a narrow side door, as the lascar's
      shouts began to echo through the precincts of the temple. &ldquo;Get your knife
      ready, he's raised the alarm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Through the door they dashed, only to find themselves in the court, hemmed
      in on every side. The frenzied cries of the lascar continued to ring
      through the enclosure; but, fortunately for the mock pilgrims, so vast was
      the concourse of natives, and so deafening the uproar, that only those
      nearest the shrine understood, his words, while even they failed, as yet
      to penetrate the clever disguise of the intruders. This gave them time to
      draw breath, and look about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Close, on their left Jack's quick eye discovered an exit, about which the
      crowd was less dense than elsewhere. The great doors stood wide open,
      disclosing a narrow street. Between this exit and the spot where they
      stood at bay, a number of sacred bulls were quietly feeding off a great
      heap of corn which the devotees had poured out upon the flags of the
      court. All this Jack's eyes took in at a glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A roar, terrific as that of ten thousand beasts of prey, burst from the
      surging multitude. The lascars words were understood. Glancing quickly
      over his shoulder, Jack saw that this man, from his place upon the steps
      of the shrine, was pointing them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another instant, and their disguise would avail them nothing; the
      maddened, fanatical crowd would be upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don,&rdquo; he said, in rapid, husky tones, as he grasped his friend's hand for
      what he believed to be the last time, &ldquo;there's but one chance left us, and
      that's a slim one. You see the door on our left, and those bulls? Do you
      take one of the two big fellows feeding side by side, and I'll take the
      other. Use your knife to guide the brute, and with God's help&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A tremendous roar of voices and a thunderous rush-of feet cut his words
      short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for it, old fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With one swift backward glance at the furious human wave sweeping down
      upon them, they darted towards the bulls, of which the two largest,
      accustomed to the daily tumult of town and temple, were still composedly
      feeding, their muzzles buried deep in the mound of corn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the animals had time to lift their heads, the mock pilgrims were on
      their backs and plying knives and heels upon their sleek flanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bellowing with pain and terror, the bulls, with tails erect and heads
      lowered, charged the throng about the doorway, bowling them over in all
      directions like so many ninepins. Before the infuriated crowd in their
      rear understood the meaning of this unexpected manoeuvre, the mock
      pilgrims were in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a side street, fortunately, separated from the densely-packed <i>maidan</i>
      by a high brick wall, and but few natives were about. Those who followed
      them out of the temple, too, they soon distanced, for their ungainly
      steeds made capital time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now a new, if less serious, danger menaced them. Apart from the
      difficulty of clinging to the round, arched backs of the bulls, once
      started, the maddened animals could not be stopped. Fortunately, they took
      the direction of the hill-path.
    </p>
    <p>
      On they tore, bellowing madly, and scattering showers of foam and sand
      right and left, until, in an amazingly brief space of time, they reached
      the outskirts of the town. Here, as if divining that their services were
      no longer required, the bulls stopped abruptly, shooting their riders off
      their backs into the sand with scant ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Regular buck-jumpers!&rdquo; groaned Jack, rubbing his lacerated shins
      ruefully. &ldquo;Glad we're safe out of it, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I. But I wonder where Spottie is?&rdquo; said Don, fanning himself with
      the loosened end of his turban.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack started up. &ldquo;Never once thought of Spottie since we entered the
      shrine,&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Come, we must go back and look him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their uneasiness on Spottie's account, however, was at that instant set at
      rest by the precipitate appearance on the scene of Spottie himself. Seeing
      his masters charge the crowd on the bulls' backs, he had extricated
      himself from the crush, and followed them with all possible speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dey coming, sar!&rdquo; he panted, as he ran up, &ldquo;Lascar debil done fetching
      plenty black man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And there swelled up from the street below a tumult of voices that left no
      doubt as to the accuracy of his statement.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>ey coming, sar!&rdquo;
       groaned Spottie; and even as he spoke the leaders of the mob came tearing
      round the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it fight or run, Don?&rdquo; said Jack quietly, adjusting his turban with
      one hand and laying the other significantly upon his knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No two ways about that! We could never stand against such odds; so we'll
      run first and fight afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And reverse the old saying, eh?&rdquo; laughed Jack. &ldquo;I should dearly love to
      have a whack at them; but if you say run, why&mdash;run it is, so here
      goes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shaking his fist at the howling mob, he sprang up the steep hill-path,
      followed closely by Don. Spottie had already made good use of his legs,
      but they soon caught him up, whereupon Jack seized the terrified native by
      the arm and dragged him over the brow of the ridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the further side they dashed, breathing easier now, for their
      movements were here well concealed by the dense jungle through which the
      pathway ran. As they emerged panting upon the sandy shore of the lagoon, a
      yell from the hill behind told them that their pursuers had gained the
      crest of the ridge. At the same instant Don pulled up abruptly, and being
      too much out of breath to speak, pointed in the direction of the canoe.
      Beside it stood a couple of natives, who, on seeing them, turned and fled
      towards the jungle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tall fellow!&rdquo; shouted Jack. &ldquo;Stop him! He's got the boathook!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boathook was their only means of propelling the canoe. That gone, they
      were practically at the mercy of their enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the flying natives they dashed, Jack leading. He quickly came up
      with the hinder-most, whom he dealt a blow that stretched him senseless in
      the sand. But the fellow who carried the boathook was long of leg and
      fresh of wind; while Jack was still a dozen yards in his rear, he gained
      the jungle and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No good!&rdquo; groaned Jack, as he relinquished the pursuit and turned back.
      &ldquo;There's nothing for it but to fight. I say, Don, what's up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don lay sprawling in the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tripped over that lazy beast,&rdquo; said Don, picking himself up and aiming a
      kick at an enormous turtle which was already heading for the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him bery nice soup making, sar!&rdquo; cried Spottie, rubbing his brown hands
      unctuously. But just then a fierce tumult of voices, rolling down from the
      jungle path, put other thoughts than soup into Spottie's pate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rope! Fetch the rope, Spottie!&rdquo; cried Jack, throwing himself on the
      turtle's back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don dragged him off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come away!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;There's no time to fetch that beast along. Are you
      out of your senses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack's only reply was to snatch the rope from Spottie's hands, rapidly
      reeve a running knot at one end, and slip the loop around the body of the
      giant chelonian, which had by this time reached the water's edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this had occupied much less time than it takes to relate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shouts of the mob now sounded ominously near. Without loss of time the
      canoe was launched, and at once Jack's purpose became apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seating himself in the bow of the canoe, he drew in the slack of the rope
      until the turtle was within easy reach, and, holding it firmly so, prodded
      it with his knife. This was a cruel act, but the stern necessity of the
      moment outweighed all other considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The turtle at once began making frantic efforts to escape from its
      tormentor; and as its weight could not have been less than three or four
      hundred pounds, and its strength in proportion, it easily and rapidly drew
      the canoe through the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes they were a stone's throw from shore&mdash;and not a
      moment too soon, for at that instant the mob of natives rushed out of the
      jungle path, and finding themselves outwitted, gave utterance to a furious
      howl of disappointment and rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canoe, thanks to the efforts of the turtle, was soon so far from shore
      that Jack considered it safe to alter their course and steer for the
      creek. No sooner did he do so than the natives set off at a run in the
      same direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dey there canoe got, maybe,&rdquo; observed Spottie, who had now recovered from
      his fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case we may have some fun yet,&rdquo; laughed Jack, lashing the turtle
      with the rope's end, as if anxious to be in time for the anticipated
      sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the creek was reached, however, not a native was to be seen;
      so, congratulating themselves on having given their pursuers the slip,
      they reached the cutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the old sailor, to say nothing of Puggles, was most anxiously
      watching for their return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shiver my mizzen!&rdquo; shouted he, as they ran under the cutter's stern; &ldquo;ha'
      ye gone an' took a mermaid in tow, lads?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; one of Spottie's turkles has taken us in tow, captain,&rdquo; replied Jack,
      setting the turtle free with a slash of his knife, in spite of Spottie's
      protestations that the creature would make &ldquo;bery nice soup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh, you cannibal!&rdquo; he added, with a glance of disgust at the black's
      chagrined face, &ldquo;you wouldn't eat the beast after he has saved your life,
      would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belay there! what's this 'ere yarn about the warmint a-savin' o' your
      lives, lads?&rdquo; sang out the captain. &ldquo;Hours ago,&rdquo; continued he, as the two
      young men, leaving Spottie to beach the canoe, scrambled on board the
      cutter, &ldquo;hours ago I says to myself, 'Mango, my boy,' says I, 'may I never
      set tooth to salt junk agin if they younkers ain't all dead men afore
      this.' says I. Howsomedever, here ye be safe an' sound; so let's hear the
      whole on it, lads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In compliance with this request Don began to relate the adventures which
      had befallen them since morning; but scarcely had he got fairly launched
      upon his narrative, when:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sharks an' sea'-sarpents!&rdquo; interrupted the captain, rising to his feet
      with a lurch, and pointing up the creek, &ldquo;what sort o' craft's this 'ere
      a-bearin' down on us? I axes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A canoe, laden to the water's edge with natives, appeared round a bend in
      the creek. Presently other canoes, to the number of half-a-dozen, hove in
      sight in rapid succession, whose occupants, perceiving their approach to
      be discovered, set up a shout that made the cliffs ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spottie was right,&rdquo; cried Jack, catching up a musket, while Don and the
      captain followed suit; &ldquo;they've found canoes, and mean to board us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire my magazine, but we'll give 'em a right warm welcome, then,&rdquo; said
      the captain. &ldquo;Look to the primin', lads, an' hold hard when I says fire,
      for blow me, these 'ere old muskets kicks like a passel o' lubberly
      donkeys, d'ye see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; Don hastily interposed, &ldquo;why not draw the bullets and load up
      with shot? The canoes are so deep in the water that a smart volley of shot
      right into the midst of the rascals is sure to make them flop over. We've
      just time to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This suggestion tickled the captain immensely, and without delay the
      change was made. The canoes were now within easy range.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready, lads,&rdquo; cried the captain:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;We always be ready,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Steady, lads, steady!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We'll fight an' we'll conquer agin and agin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Up went the muskets. At sight of them the natives rested on their oars, or
      rather paddles, and the canoes slowed down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cliffs trembled beneath the treble report. Jack, who in his excitement
      had forgotten the captain's caution, went sprawling backwards over the
      thwarts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho, ho, ho! flint-locks an' small-shot, a wolley's the thing, lads,&rdquo;
       roared the captain, pointing up the creek as the smoke rolled, away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;We ne'er see our foes but we wants 'em to stay,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      An' they never see us but they wants us away;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      When they runs, why, we follows an' runs 'em ashore,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      For if they won't fight us, we can't do no more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;wolley&rdquo; had told. Driven frantic by the stinging shot, the natives
      had leapt to their feet and overturned four out of the seven deeply-laden
      canoes, whose late occupants were now struggling in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've a softer berth of it than I, anyway,&rdquo; said Jack from the bottom
      of the boat, as he rubbed his shoulder ruefully. &ldquo;I shall get at the
      muzzle end of your thundering old blunderbuss next time, captain. Hullo,
      there's that rascally&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of the exclamation was drowned in the creek, for as he
      uttered it Jack took a header over the stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shift my ballast, what's the young dog arter now? I axes,&rdquo; cried the
      captain, gazing aghast at the spot where Jack had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      His speedy reappearance solved the riddle. By the queue he grasped a
      dripping, half-naked native, whom he dragged after him to the beach. It
      was the lascar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah! he's got him this time,&rdquo; shouted Don, leaping out upon the sands
      to lend a hand in landing the prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the lascar struggled fiercely for liberty; but as Jack was by no
      means particular to keep his head above water, he soon quieted down, and
      presently, with Dons assistance, was hauled out on the sands, where he
      fell on his knees and began whining piteously for mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your revolver, Don,&rdquo; gasped Jack, with a watery side-wink at his friend.
      &ldquo;He shall tell us what he knows of the pearls, or die like the dog he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don placed the revolver in his hand, ready cocked. The lascar grovelled in
      the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sa'b, sa'b!&rdquo; he whined, &ldquo;you no shoot, me telling anyting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt you will,&rdquo; replied Jack significantly, pressing the muzzle of
      the weapon to his forehead; &ldquo;but what I want is the truth. Now, then, has
      old Salambo sold the pearls yet? Come, out with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He n-n-no selling, sa'b,&rdquo; stammered the terrified native, shrinking as
      far away from the pistol as Jack's hold on his queue would permit &ldquo;Where
      are they, then? Come, look sharp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He d-d-done hiding in Elephant Rock, s-s-sa'b,&rdquo; confessed the lascar,
      apparently on the point of fainting with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don! Captain! Do you hear that?&rdquo; cried Jack, half-turning, in the
      excitement produced by this disclosure, towards his friends. &ldquo;He says old
      Salambo's hid the pearls in the &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      Phew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, with a shrill whistle of dismay. By a quick upward stroke of
      his arm the lascar had sent the revolver spinning, and at the same instant
      wrenched himself free from his captor's grasp. Ere Jack could stir hand or
      foot, he had plunged headlong into the creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him go,&rdquo; said Jack tranquilly, as the water closed over the fellow's
      heels; &ldquo;we've got an important clue out of him, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain slowly lowered the musket he had raised for a shot at the
      fugitive should he comet to the surface within range, and said
      approvingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, lad! Spike my guns, I've heard tell as how that 'ere Elephant
      Rock's riddled from main-deck to keelson, so to say, with gangways, and
      air-wents, an' sich. Howsomedever, that's matter for arter reflection, as
      the whale said to himself when he swallied Jonah. The warmints astarn
      there&rdquo;&mdash;indicating that part of the creek where the occupants of the
      canoes had taken their involuntary bath&mdash;&ldquo;the warmints astarn ha'
      sheered off a p'int or two; so now, lads, let's tackle the perwisions
      afore the wail o' night descends, an' then to work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;wail o' night&rdquo; was not long in descending, for the sun had
      disappeared with the lascar. Ere they had done justice to the ample meal
      which Puggles set before them, and exchanged the draggled pilgrim garb for
      their everyday clothes, the shadows had crept silently from their
      hiding-places beneath thicket and cliff, and blotted out the last
      lingering touch of day from the bosom of the creek. Save the musical
      chirping of some amorous tree-frog to his mate, or the lazy swish of wings
      as some belated flying-fox swung slowly past, unbroken silence reigned
      between the darkling cliffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the captain's opinion, no immediate repetition of the recent attack was
      to be feared. But the events of the day had made it only too plain that
      their present position was far from being-one of security. To remain on
      board the cutter would be to invite daily skirmishes with the natives,
      which would not only deter the quest of the golden pearl, but prove a
      source of constant annoyance and danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as the captain knew, the island afforded no safer retreat than the
      hill of the Haunted Pagodas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The natives of the island, he said, believed this hill to be the abode of
      a witch in the form of a ferocious tiger, merely to look upon which meant
      death. For this reason they would on no account venture near it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So upon the Haunted Pagodas they resolved to fall back without delay. But
      here an unforeseen difficulty arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the path to the summit of the hill none of the party was acquainted
      except the captain, and he was unwilling that the precious cutter should
      be entrusted to the care of any one except himself while the several
      journeys necessary for the removal of the stores were being made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shiver my main-brace!&rdquo; roared he, thumping the bottom of the boat with
      his wooden leg after they had talked it all over. &ldquo;Shiver my mainbrace!
      I'll go the first trip with ye, lads, an' trust the old cutter to luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, captain,&rdquo; said Jack persuasively &ldquo;why not trust her to me? It's
      for only one trip, as you say; and besides, there's not much danger of an
      attack to-night. You said so yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this arrangement the old sailor finally agreed. So Don, Spottie, and
      Puggles loaded up with the stores and other necessaries for their proposed
      sojourn on the summit of the hill, and a start was made, the captain
      leading with musket and lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Jack!&rdquo; Don called back, as he struck into the jungle at the
      captain's heels. &ldquo;'Fire a gun if you want help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, old fellow,&rdquo; was Jack's careless reply. &ldquo;Good-bye till I see
      you again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      'So, with no other companion than Bosin, he was left alone to guard the
      cutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the difficulties of the captain's party began in earnest. The path
      before them was, it is true, scarce half a mile in length, but so
      precipitous was the hillside, so overgrown the track, that every furlong
      seemed a league. The tangled, overhanging jungle growth not only
      completely shut out the rays of the moon, but by its thickness impeded
      their progress at every step, as though determined to guard the abode of
      the witch-tiger from all human intrusion. To make matters worse, they had
      neglected to provide themselves with an axe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shiver my main-brace!&rdquo; the captain cried, as his wooden leg stuck fast in
      a tangled mass of creepers. &ldquo;These 'ere land trips be a pesky sight worse
      nor a sea woyage, says you! Blow me! I'd ruther round the Horn in
      mid-winter than wade through such wegetation as this 'ere in midnight
      darkness! Howsomedever, the port's afore us, so up we goes, as Jonah says
      to the whale when he bid the warmint adoo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up they went accordingly, and after much stumbling and tough climbing,
      reached the summit and the Haunted Pagodas. Finding here a clear space and
      bright moonlight, they quickly relieved themselves of their loads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' now, lads,&rdquo; cried the captain, &ldquo;wear ship an' back to the cutter,
      says you. Fire my magazine! what's that? I axes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sharp and distinct upon the night air there floated up from the darkness
      of the ravine the report of a gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don felt his heart stand still with dread, then race at lightning speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An attack!&rdquo; he cried hoarsely; &ldquo;and Jack alone! Hurry, captain!&mdash;for
      God's sake hurry!
    </p>
    <p>
      Easier said than done. Haste only added to the difficulties of the way. It
      seemed to Don that he should never shake off the retarding clutch of the
      jungle.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last their weary feet pressed again the sands of the little beach. But
      now a new terror seized them. The beach was illuminated by a ruddy, fitful
      glow..The cutter was on fire!
    </p>
    <p>
      Don cleared the sands almost at a bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; he shouted, leaping the cutter's rail, and with lightning glance
      scanning the bottom of the boat, and then the cuddy, for some sign of his
      friend. &ldquo;Jack, where are you? Captain, he's not here! and&mdash;my God!
      look at this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon the bottom of the boat, showing darkly crimson in the ruddy
      firelight, lay a pool of blood, and beside it a discharged musket.

      fortunately, had gained so little headway that a few bucketfuls of water
      sufficed to put the <i>Jolly Tar</i> cut of danger. Then the captain
      stumped up to Don, where he sat disconsolate on the cutter's gun'le, and
      laid a sympathetic hand upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up, my hearty! They warmints ain't done for Master Jack yet, not by
      a long chalk, says I. Flush my scuppers, lad!&rdquo; he roared in stentorian
      tones, as he turned the light of the lantern upon the pool of blood, &ldquo;this
      'ere sanguinary gore as dyes the deck bain't his'n at all. It's the blood
      o' some native warmint, what he's gone an' let daylight into, d'ye mind
      me, an' here's the musket as done the trick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think he's not&mdash;not dead?&rdquo; asked Don, steadying his voice
      with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead? Not him! Alive he is, and alive he remains,&rdquo; cried the old sailor.
      &ldquo;An' why so? you naterally axes. To begin with, as the shark says when he
      nipped the seaman's leg off, because the keg o' powder's gone. Spurts, the
      warmints thinks to theirselves, an' so they makes away with <i>it.</i>
      Secondly&rdquo;&mdash;and here the old sailor's voice grew husky&mdash;&ldquo;because
      that 'ere imp of a Besin's gone. 'I'll stand hard by Master Jack,' says
      he, so off <i>he</i> goes. Sharks an' sea-sarpents, lad, can't ye see as
      the lubbers have only gone an' took Master Jack in tow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can't understand,&rdquo; persisted Don, &ldquo;why they should do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ransom, lad, that's what the lubbers is arter. Master Jack's life's worth
      a sight more'n a bag o' pearls, an' well they knows it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Avast there, an' don't be a milksop so soft,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To be taken for trifles aback;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      There's a Providence, lad, as sits up aloft
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To watch for the life of poor Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Trolling out this sailorly reproof of Don's fears, the captain stretched
      himself in the bottom of the boat, and drawing a tai paulin over his nose,
      was soon sleeping off the effects of his recent exertions ashore. But upon
      Don's heart his chum's fate lay like a leaden weight. He could not rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, old fellow, till I see you again.&rdquo; These, Jack's last careless
      words, repeated themselves in every me urnful sigh of the night-wind; and
      as he lay, hour after hour, watching the stars climb the heavens; he
      wondered, with a keen pain at his heart, when that &ldquo;again&rdquo; was to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the night wore on, however, he found more and more comfort in the old
      sailor's words. It was so much easier to believe that Jack had been
      kidnapped than to believe him dead. This view of his disappearance, too,
      was altogether in keeping with the shark-charmer's cunning. As for
      himself, he would gladly have cried quits with old Salambo then and there,
      if by so doing he could have recalled Jack to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he fell into a troubled sleep, unconscious of the fact that
      another brain than his was busy with Jack's fate. Had he but known it,
      Bosin deserved more than a passing thought that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      By daybreak they were again astir, and within an hour the cutter lay
      snugly ensconced in the shelter of a deep, vine-draped cavern beneath the
      cliff, some hundred yards down the creek, of which the captain knew. In
      carrying out this part of the old sailor's plan, the canoe, for which an
      effective paddle was improvised out of an old oar, proved of signal
      service; and when the smaller skiff had in its turn been hidden away in
      the dense jungle bordering the beach, they loaded up with the remaining
      stores, and took the pathway to the Haunted Pagodas, which they eventually
      reached just as the sun, like a huge ball of fire, rolled up out of the
      eastern sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the captain had said, the Haunted Pagodas was indeed &ldquo;a tidy spot to
      fall back upon.&rdquo; Ages before, a circle of massive temples had crowned the
      summit of this island hill; but for full a thousand years had Nature
      searched out with silent, prying fingers the minutest crevices of the
      closer-cemented stones, ruthlessly destroying what man had so proudly
      reared, until nothing save a confusion of tumble down walls and broken
      pillars, grotesquely draped with climbing vines and like parasitic
      growths, remained to mark the site of the erstwhile stately cloisters. A
      shuddery spot it was!&mdash;a likely lurking-place for reptile or wild
      beast, so uncanny in its weird union of jungle wildness and dead men's
      work, that one would scarcely have been surprised had the terrible
      witch-tiger of the native legend suddenly leapt out upon one from some
      dark pit or sunless recess.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one spot alone had the walls successfully resisted the action of the
      insinuating roots. This was a sort of cloister with a floor of stone, upon
      which the roof had fallen. But when the <i>debris</i> had been cleared
      away, and the stores scattered about in its stead, this corner of the
      ruins looked positively homelike and comfortable&mdash;especially when
      Puggles, taking possession of one of its angles, converted it into a
      kitchen, and began active preparations for breakfast. The captain dubbed
      their new retreat &ldquo;the fo'csle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All that day the old sailor was in an unusually thoughtful mood. Every
      half-hour or so he would produce his pipe and take a number of slow,
      meditative &ldquo;whiffs o' the fragrant,&rdquo; after which he would slap his thigh
      energetically with one horny hand, and stump back and forth amid the ruins
      in a state of high excitement, until, something going wrong with his train
      of thought, the pipe had to be relighted, and the difficulty, like the
      tobacco, smoked out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This characteristic process of &ldquo;ilin' up his runnin' gear&rdquo; he continued
      far on into the afternoon, when he abruptly laid the huge meerschaum
      aside, took a critical survey of sea and sky, and, bearing down on Don,
      where he sat cleaning the muskets, without further ado planted a
      resounding thump on that young gentleman's back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blow me!&rdquo; he burst out, as if Don was already initiated into his train of
      thought, &ldquo;the wery identical thing, lad. An what's that? you naterally
      axes. Why, d'ye see, I've been splicin' o' my idees together a bit, so to
      say, an' shiver my main-brace if I ain't gone an' rescued Master Jack!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Edging away a little lest the captain's rising excitement should again
      culminate in one of his well-meant, but none the less undesirable thumps,
      &ldquo;You mean, I suppose,&rdquo; said Don, &ldquo;that you've hit upon a plan for his
      rescue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, lad,&rdquo; assented the captain, &ldquo;but an idee well spun is a deed half
      done, d'ye mind me. Howsomedever, let's take our bearin's afore we runs
      for port, says you. An' to begin with, as the shark said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What the shark said, as well as what the captain was about to say, was
      doomed to remain for ever a matter of conjecture, for at that instant
      Puggles set up a shout that effectually interrupted the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sa'b! sar! me done see um, sa'b. Him done come back, sar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Naturally enough, Don's first thought was of Jack. He sprang to his feet,
      his heart giving a wild leap of joy, and then standing still with
      suspense. For in all the clearing no human form appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Puggles had now reached his master's side. &ldquo;Him there got, sa'b, there!&rdquo;
       he reiterated, pointing towards the narrow break in the jungle which
      indicated the starting-point of the pathway to the creek. Between this
      point and the spot where they stood, the jungle grass grew thick and tall.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they looked they saw it sway in a long, wavy undulation, as if some
      living thing were rapidly making its way towards them. In another moment
      the rank covert parted, and there appeared, not Jack, but Bosin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knots an' marlinspikes!&rdquo; ejaculated the delighted captain, as the monkey
      scrambled chattering upon his knee. &ldquo;What's this 'ere as the imp o'
      darkness's been an' made a prize of? I axes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Around the monkey's neck a shred of draggled, blood-stained linen was
      securely bound. Already Don was fumbling at the knot, his face whiter than
      the rag itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A message from Jack!&rdquo; he announced joyfully, when at length the
      tightly-drawn knot yielded, and a scrap of paper fluttered to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shiver my main-brace!&rdquo; roared the captain, bringing his hand down on that
      unoffending member as if about to give a practical demonstration of his
      words, &ldquo;ain't I said as much all along, lad? Alive he is, an' alive he
      remains. An' blow me if ever I see anything to beat this 'ere method o'
      excommunicating atween friends, says I. So let's hear what Master Jack has
      got to say for hisself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don had already run his eye over the pencilled writing. &ldquo;He's all right,
      thank God!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in a tone of intense relief. &ldquo;Wounded, as I
      feared&mdash;a mere scratch, he says&mdash;but you shall hear for
      yourself:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Don't be cut up, old fellow,'&rdquo; he read aloud, &ldquo;'it will all come light
      in the end. The niggers pounced down on me before I heard them. Just had
      time to let off one of the captain's old kickers, when a crack on the head
      laid me out. I'm in a village on the sea-shore, and by great good luck I
      can see the hill and the smoke of what, I suppose, is your fire, from the
      window of the hut they've stuck me in. It doesn't seem quite so bad when I
      look at that.... Bosin just turned up. Am writing in hopes he'll carry
      this safely to you. Close prisoner. Have to scribble when the beggars
      aren't watching me. Overheard them palavering just now. They take me to
      the E. R. to-night&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which he means the Elephant Rock!&rdquo; cried the captain, interrupting. &ldquo;Blow
      me! I knowed as that 'ere Elephant 'ud go an' make wittles of him, d'ye
      see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don nodded and read on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Old Salambo's work this. He means to make terms for the pearls&mdash;&mdash;'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Copper my bottom, lad! Them's the wery identical words as I've stood by
      all along!&rdquo; the captain broke in again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; said Don impatiently. &ldquo;There's something important here. I
      couldn't make it out before, the writing's so scrawly towards the end.
      Listen to this: 'There's a streak down the face of the hill, that looks
      like a path to the village here. If Bosin's in time, come early. Don't let
      the hdkf.(sp) alarm you; it's a mere scratch.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reading off these last words rapidly, Don pointed to the sun, already
      half-hidden by the western horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no time to lose, captain! He must be set free before he's taken
      to the Rock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, lad; so let's tumble out and man the guns!&rdquo; cried the captain,
      lurching to his feet and giving his pantaloons a determined hitch-up.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;We always be ready!
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Steady, lad, steady!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      We'll fight an' we'll conquer agin and agin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we will,&rdquo; assented Don heartily; &ldquo;but first we must get the bearings
      of this village, captain. Where's the glass? Spottie! Hi, Spottie!&mdash;the
      glass here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In response to the summons, Puggles ran up with the captain's telescope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spottie done go fetch water, sa'b,&rdquo; he explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a village,&rdquo; Don announced, after adjusting the instrument and
      carefully sweeping the sea-shore. &ldquo;Just there, in that clump of trees; the
      only one within range, so far as I can see. Do you make it out, captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the captain, taking the glass; &ldquo;there's a willage below, sure
      as sharks is sharks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next thing, then,&rdquo; continued Don, &ldquo;is to find this path Jack speaks
      of. 'Twould take us two good hours at least to go round by way of the
      creek. Do you know, I've a notion the path to the spring is the one we
      want. Suppose we try it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain making no demur, Don caught up a musket and led the way to the
      spring. This spring was Spottie's discovery. It lay to the left of the
      creek path, about fifty yards down the hillside. The jungle had almost
      obliterated the path by which it was approached, but this the black had in
      some degree remedied by a vigorous use of the axe during the day, and, as
      Puggles had intimated, he was now at the spring, replenishing the water
      bucket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had Don and the captain got fairly into the path when there rose
      from the depths of the jungle immediately below them a series of frantic
      yells. The voice was undoubtedly Spottie's, and, judging from the manner
      in which he used it, Sputtie stood&mdash;or believed he stood&mdash;in
      sore need of assistance. Quickening his pace to a run, Don soon came upon
      him, making for the open, minus bucket and turban, his eyes protruding
      from their sockets, and altogether in a terrible state of fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; cried Don, catching him by the arm and shaking him
      until he was fain to cease his bellowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De t-t-tiger-witch, sa'b!&rdquo; said Spottie, his teeth chattering. &ldquo;Me done
      see um, sa'b!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the captain came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's seen a monkey or something, and thinks it's the tiger-witch,&rdquo;
       explained Don, laughing at the poor fellows piteous face. &ldquo;Whereabouts is
      it, Spottie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spottie pointed fearfully down the shadowy pathway, where a faint snapping
      of twigs could be heard in the underbrush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blow me!&rdquo; said the captain, after listening intently a moment, &ldquo;yon
      warmint bain't no monkey, lad. So let's lay alongside an' diskiver what
      quarter o' the animile kingdom he hails from, says you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that he started off in the direction of the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bidding Spottie remain where he was, Don followed. The captain was,
      perhaps, ten paces in advance. Suddenly the jungle parted with a loud
      swish, and a tawny body shot through the air and alighted full upon the
      captain's back, bearing him to the ground ere he could utter so much as a
      cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don stood petrified. Then a savage, guttural growling, accompanied by a
      sickening crunching sound, roused him to the old sailors danger. There was
      just sufficient light left to show the two figures on the ground&mdash;the
      tiger atop, his fangs buried in the captains thigh. Priming the musket
      rapidly with some loose powder he happened to have in his pocket, Don
      sprang to the captain's aid. The tiger lifted its head at his approach
      with an angry snarl, but this was no time to think of his own danger.
      Quick as thought he thrust the muzzle of the musket between the beast's
      jaws and fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instant later and he was on his back. The tiger had sprung clean over
      him, knocking him down in its passage, and now lay some yards away,
      writhing in the death struggle. Don picked himself up and ran to the old
      sailor's side. As he reached the spot where he lay, the captain struggled
      into a sitting posture, and stared about him bewilderedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stave my bulkhead!&rdquo; roared he, &ldquo;if this bain't the purtiest go as ever I
      see. An' what quarter o' the animile kingdom might the warmint hail from?
      I axes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A tiger, captain; a genuine man-eater. But, I say, are you hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurt is it?&rdquo; demanded the captain. &ldquo;Why, dye see, lad,&rdquo; first adjusting
      his neckcloth, and then proceeding to feel himself carefully over,
      &ldquo;barrin' this 'ere bit of a chafe to my figgerhead, I hain't started a
      nail, d'ye see. Avast there! Shiver my main-brace, what's this? I axes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just where the &ldquo;main-brace&rdquo; was spliced upon the thigh, a sad rent in the
      captain's broad pantaloons showed the wooden portion of his anatomy to be
      deeply indented and splintered. At this discovery he stopped aghast in the
      process of feeling for broken bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, don't you see how it is?&rdquo; laughed Don. &ldquo;The brute has tried to make
      a meal off your wooden leg, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain burst into one of his tremendous guffaws. &ldquo;Blow me if I don't
      admire the warmint's taste,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;An uncommon affectionate un he is,
      says you, so let's pay our respec's to him 'ithout delay, lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tiger proved to be a magnificent specimen of his tribe; and, as he
      stood over the 'tawny carcase in the waning light, Don could not repress a
      feeling of pardonable pride at thought of his own share in the adventure
      which had ended so disastrously for the superb creature at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; said he presently, when that worthy had inspected and admired
      the striped monster to his heart's content, &ldquo;Captain, it strikes me as
      being somewhat of a rare thing to run against a fullblown tiger on an
      island like this. Don't you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, that it is,&rdquo; assented the captain; &ldquo;rare as sea-sarpents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That explains it, then: the tiger-witch story, I mean. This chap's great
      size, and the fact that man-eaters aren't often met with on these little
      nutshell islands, have made him the terror of the whole community, you
      see. He's their witch, I'll be bound. Now.&rdquo; he ran on, seeing the captain
      express his approval of this likely explanation by a series of emphatic
      nods, &ldquo;now I'll tell you what I mean to do. Dear old Jack's a prisoner,
      and we're bound to get him out of limbo if we can. His captors&mdash;those
      native beggars&mdash;go in mortal terror of this beast here. Good! Why
      shouldn't Pug and I carry the creature's skin down to the village yonder&mdash;where
      Jack is, you know&mdash;use it to impersonate the witch-tiger, and terrify
      the niggers&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got no farther with his explanation, for the captain, having already
      grasped the idea, at this point grasped its originator by the hand, and
      cut in with: &ldquo;Spike my guns, the wery identical thing, lad! Blow me, the
      lubberly swabs'll tumble into the jungle like a lot o' porpoises when they
      sees that 'ere tiger-skin a-hangin' on your recreant limbs. An' then
      hooray for Master Jack, says you! Why not? I axes.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IX.&mdash;WAS IT JACK?
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hat a night it
      was! Overhead one glorious; maze of scintillating stars; in the jungle
      ebon: blackness, shot with the soft glow of myriad fireflies, that flashed
      their tiny lamps only to leave-the spot they had illumined more intensely
      black than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don's surmise as to the spring path proved correct&mdash;it extended quite
      to the foot of the hill, where it merged almost imperceptibly into the
      scantier vegetation fringing the sea-shore. After a hard fight with the
      difficulties of the way&mdash;increased in no small degree by the dead
      weight of the tiger-skin&mdash;he and Puggles at length reached the limits
      of the jungle and paused for breath. The utmost caution was now necessary
      in order to avoid untimely discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was not yet up, and the cocoa-nut <i>tope</i> in which, but a
      stoned throw away, nestled the village that formed at once their
      destination and Jack's place of imprisonment, lay wrapped in gloom so
      impenetrable that not a single outline of tree or hut could be
      distinguished from where they stood. Excepting a faint glow, which at
      infrequent intervals flickered amid the lofty branches of the palm-trees,
      there was nothing to show that the spot was tenanted by any human being.
      This light&mdash;or, to speak more correctly, this reflection of a light&mdash;Don
      attributed to a fire in the village street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They done lighting um for company, maybe,&rdquo; suggested Puggles. &ldquo;Plenty
      people going feast, black man 'fraid got, making fire keep tiger-witch
      off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better for us,&rdquo; said his master; &ldquo;especially if everybody's
      at the town except the fellows in charge of Jack. But shut up, Pug; it
      won't do to risk their overhearing our palaver.&rdquo; With stealthy steps they
      advanced, pausing often to listen, until they gained the deeper shade of
      the trees close under the rear of the huts. Leaving the black boy here,
      Don skirted the nearer row of cabins and took a cautious view of the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The huts stood in two irregular rows, one facing the other, and midway
      down the open space or street between was a smouldering fire of brushwood,
      about which, in listless, drowsy attitudes, there lolled a group of
      perhaps twenty natives. Save for these the place, so far as he could make
      out, was quite deserted. The doors of the huts were closed, and no glimmer
      of lamp or fire shone through them to indicate that any occupants were
      within. A little to one side of the fire the light fell upon an object at
      sight of which Don started violently. It was the stolen keg of powder.
      Jack could not be far off, then!
    </p>
    <p>
      Quitting the spot as noiselessly as he had approached it, he made his way
      back to the rear of the huts, and with the assistance of Puggles, adjusted
      the limp tigers pelt upon his back, shoulders, and head. Next he gave the
      black boy his orders. He was to lie close until the natives about the fire
      took to flight&mdash;which, if they fled at all, would, in the ordinary
      course of events, be in the direction of the other extremity of the street&mdash;when
      he was to join his master in searching the huts.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was now in readiness, and Don, gripping the defunct tiger's ears at
      either side of his head to hold the skin in position, once more skirted
      the row of huts, Puggles in close attendance. His former post of
      observation gained, he went down upon all-fours, and when Puggles had
      readjusted the skin to his satisfaction, in this attitude he boldly
      advanced into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distance to be traversed in order to reach the group about the fire
      was not less than fifty yards. He had covered a third of the ground
      unobserved, when one of the natives rose to his feet and threw a fresh
      bundle of faggots on the smouldering embers. Fanned by the breeze, the
      fire blazed up fiercely, illuminating the street from end to end. The
      tiger-witch uttered a terrific roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this sound fell upon the ears of the native, he wheeled and peered
      fearfully into the semi-darkness in which Don's end of the street lay. A
      second roar brought a second native to his feet. He was followed by
      another and another, till all were on the alert. The witch-tiger was now
      in full view.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a little while the group about the fire hesitated. Should they stand
      their ground or decamp? As the intruder advanced, and the ruddy firelight
      threw its gruesome outlines into stronger relief, they suddenly perceived
      what manner of apparition this was that had stolen up an them out of the
      darkness. To them the tiger-witch, with its swift, silent visitations of
      death, had doubtless long been a dread reality. The island held but one
      tiger&mdash;and here it was! With frantic outcries they turned and fled
      pell-mell down the village street.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was just what Don desired&mdash;what he had calculated upon. Until
      the heels of the hindermost had quite disappeared in the darkness, he
      sustained his rôle. Thus far the ruse had succeeded admirably. But the
      real business of the night had as yet only begun. Shaking the clammy skin
      from off his back, he rose to his feet and made a dash for the door of the
      nearest hut. Just as he reached it, Puggles, who had watched the rout of
      the natives with shaking sides, came trotting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look alive, Pug!&rdquo; cried his master, bursting in the frail door with a
      crash. &ldquo;Search the huts on the left, while I take these on the right. Look
      alive, I say&mdash;they may come back at any minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Puggles needed no urging. He was only too well aware of the danger that
      threatened his master and his own precious self should the fugitives think
      better of their cowardice and reappear on, the scene. He set to work with
      a will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into hut after hut they forced their way, peering into every nook and
      corner, and calling upon Jack as loudly as they dared; only to receive for
      answer the dull echoes of their own shouts. Nowhere was there any sign of
      Jack. &ldquo;Had he been already removed?&rdquo; Don asked himself desperately, as he
      sped from door to door. It almost seemed so; but while a single hut
      remained unsearched there was still hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-a-dozen only were left, when the catastrophe he had all along been
      dreading actually occurred. The natives came trooping back. To their
      infinite relief, no doubt, the witch-tiger had vanished, and in its stead
      appeared two human figures darting from hut to hut. The natives raised a
      shout of defiance and pressed forward to the attack, catching up as
      weapons whatever came first to hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing the street at a bound, Don joined the black boy, just as the
      latter emerged from the doorway of a hut, and thrust into his hands one of
      two pistols with which he had come provided. Backing against the door of
      the hut, with pistols drawn they awaited the attack. It began with a
      rattling volley of missiles, but the low, projecting thatch of the native
      dwelling, jutting out as it did several feet from the wall, served to
      somewhat break the force of the stony hail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't fire till I give the word,&rdquo; said Don between his teeth. &ldquo;We can't
      afford to waste a shot. The beggars are drawing their knives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words had barely left his lips when, with a shout and a disorderly
      rush, the crowd broke for the spot where they stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready, Pug. Fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously with the sharp crack of the pistols, there leapt skyward
      from mid-street a sudden, blinding flash of lurid light, accompanied by
      dense volumes of sulphurous smoke, and a thunderous shock that shook the
      walls of the huts to their foundations. Don and his companion were dashed
      violently through the door against which they stood, and hurled upon the
      floor within. A thick shower of sand and stones rattled about and upon
      them. But of this fact they were unconscious. The shock had stunned them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Don came to himself he found Puggles seated on the ground by his
      side, blubbering dismally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only was the roof ablaze, but showers of glowing sparks fell thickly
      upon them. The floor of the hut was a bed of fire, the heat intolerable.
      Puggs, dazed &ldquo;by the recent shock, and stupefied with fright, seemed to
      comprehend not a word that was said to him. Don accordingly seized him by
      the arm and dragged him into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter? Where are the natives?&rdquo; he demanded, struggling to his
      feet, and scanning the interior of the hut with bewildered eyes. &ldquo;Hullo,
      the roof's on fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0010" id="linkimage-0010"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0143.jpg" alt="0143 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0143.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Here the scene was appalling indeed. How long he had lain insensible he
      could not tell; but the time thus spent upon the floor of the hut must
      have been considerable, for from end to end the double line of thatched
      dwellings was wrapped in flames that shot high into the inky air, and
      there united in one roaring, swirling canopy of fire above the narrow
      thoroughfare. As if to render the spectacle more awful, here and there lay
      stretched upon the ground the mangled, blackened body of a native. Through
      one of these a sharp splinter of wood had been driven. Don examined it
      curiously. Then&mdash;he had been too dazed to realise it before&mdash;the
      truth flashed upon him. The keg of powder had exploded!
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst crossing the street to Pug's side he had noticed, he remembered
      now, that the head, of the keg was stove in. It then lay close beside the
      fire, within a few feet of the scene of the attack. It was not there now,
      but in its stead was a shallow, blackened cavity. That told the whole
      story of the explosion. A handful of powder carelessly scattered, a wisp
      of straw kicked into the fire amid the rush of feet, a chance spark even,
      and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sa'b, sa'b, the huts done tumble in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Puggles was tugging at his sleeve, and pointing fearfully down the street.
      For an instant Don gazed into the black boy's face blankly, not grasping
      the import of his words. Then, like a repetition of that lurid flash of
      light which had burnt itself into his very brain, came the recollection of
      Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sudden return of the natives had left but half-a-dozen huts
      unsearched. These were situated at the extreme end of the street&mdash;the
      end opposite to that from which Don and Puggles had approached the
      village. Towards these the former now ran, only to discover, to his
      consternation, that the fire was before him. For in this direction the
      wind blew, and the unsearched huts, like the rest, were a seething mass of
      flames. Of all save one the roofs had already given way, while at the very
      moment he ran up that also crashed in.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the blood-red flames shot skyward, an agonised, inarticulate shriek
      rose from within the glowing walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it Jack?
    </p>
    <p>
      Shielding his face with his hands, Don attempted to force an entrance, but
      the heat of the furnace-like doorway drove him back. In frantic accents he
      called his chum by name&mdash;called again and again&mdash;to be answered
      only by the hissing of the pitiless flame-tongues that licked the black
      heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it Jack? Had the natives who escaped&mdash;if, indeed, any did&mdash;the
      deadly effects of the explosion, carried him with them in their flight
      from the burning village, or had he been mercilessly abandoned to a fiery
      grave within his prison walls?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a terrible question; but not that night, nor for many nights to
      come, was he to know whether those unnumbered moments of unconsciousness
      had consigned his chum to continued captivity or to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing only was certain: their mission to the village had reached a
      disastrous climax. To remain longer where they were was useless; to follow
      the trail of the natives who had escaped, impossible. No course was left
      but immediate return to the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weary, dejected, with aching bodies and aching hearts&mdash;for even
      light-hearted Puggles, heathen though he was, felt crushed by their sad
      misadventure&mdash;they sought the spot where, the axe and lantern had
      been left, and then set their blackened faces towards the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the moon had risen, making the task of finding the footpath
      an easy one. Just as they turned their backs upon the beach and the
      burning village, out upon the tense stillness of the night&mdash;a
      stillness softened rather than broken by the music of the surf&mdash;from
      the shadowy hill above rang the sharp report of a gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something wrong up there, I'm afraid,&rdquo; said Don, rousing himself and
      pausing to listen. &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; as a second report broke the stillness, &ldquo;there
      goes another! Come, Pug, we must pull ourselves together a bit and get
      over the ground faster. The captain's not a man to waste powder; those
      reports mean danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him maybe another lubberly warmint shooting, sa'b,&rdquo; Pug suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless I'm very much mistaken, there's something a jolly sight worse
      afoot,&rdquo; was his master's uneasy rejoinder as they began the ascent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and there upon the hillside were spots where the rains of many
      summers had so washed away the thin surface-soil as to lay bare the rock
      beneath and leave little or no roothold for vegetation. As he paused for a
      brief breathing space in one of these clearings, Don's attention was drawn
      to a dull red glare, which, though but a short distance in advance of the
      spot where he stood, had up to that moment been quite concealed by the
      intervening jungle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Pug, what do you make of that light?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The black boy knuckled his eyes vigorously, as if to assure himself they
      were playing him no trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me linking there one fire got, sa'b,&rdquo; said he, after a long look at the
      mysterious light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case we'd better stir our stumps. The breeze seems to be
      freshening, and once the fire gets a hold on this tindery jungle, why,
      there's no knowing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There another got, sa'b!&rdquo; broke in Puggles, pointing excitedly to the
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phew! And, by Jove, there's a third beyond that again! And the wind's
      blowing straight for the camp, too! Now I understand why the captain fired
      those shots! The hill's on fire! Point, Pug!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up the hillside they bounded, panting, stumbling. There was light enough
      now and to spare, for the fire towards which they were advancing had made
      more headway than at first sight appeared. The wonder was that they had
      not observed it sooner; but this perhaps was sufficiently accounted for by
      the fact that the thoughts of both had lagged behind in the burning
      village.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point of danger was soon reached. The fire had not yet crossed the
      path, but only a few yards of tindery underbrush separated the swaying
      wall of flame-shot smoke from the narrow trail, while every instant the
      margin grew perceptibly less.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for it, Pug!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don raced past with head lowered, the greedy flames licking his face.
      Half-blinded, he stumbled on for a dozen yards or so before turning to
      ascertain how Puggles had stood the ordeal. To his horror he then
      discovered that the fire had swallowed up the pathway at a single bound,
      and that Puggles was nowhere to be seen.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.&mdash;IN WHICH THE OLD SAW, &ldquo;OUT OF THE FRYING-PAN, INTO THE
      FIRE,&rdquo; IS REVERSED WITH STARTLING EFFECT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>ack he ran,
      battling with the flames and sparks that rolled in volumes up the
      hillside, until, half-stifled and well-nigh fainting from the heat, he was
      forced to turn and flee for his life before the swiftly advancing flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Puggles, terrified by the close proximity of the fire, had hung
      back at the last moment, or whether he had attempted to follow his master
      and paid for his devotion with his life, heaven alone knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor chap!&rdquo; gasped Don, as he stumbled free of the smoke and turned for a
      last look at the fiery veil so suddenly drawn over his faithful servant's
      fate. &ldquo;God help him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rapid advance of the fire, however, allowed little time for the
      indulgence of emotion. The long rainless months had scorched the face of
      the hill until the thick-set bamboo copse was as dry as tinder,
      inflammable as shavings. The wind and the steepness of the hillside, too,
      proved powerful allies of the flames. On and up they swept, leaping from
      point to point with such rapidity that Don found it necessary to strain
      every nerve to avoid being overtaken by the greedy holocaust. Glad indeed
      was he when, the scene of his recent adventure passed, he at length
      emerged upon the comparatively open ground abreast of the encampment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stumping uneasily to and fro, &ldquo;abaft the fo'csle,&rdquo; with Bosin perched
      contentedly upon his shoulder, was the old sailor&mdash;the jerky creak,
      creak of his wooden leg showing him to be in an unusually disturbed state
      of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right glad I am to clap eyes on ye, lad!&rdquo; he sang out cheerily on
      catching sight of the returned wanderer. &ldquo;An' whereaway's Master Jack an'
      the leetle nigger, I axes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain paused abruptly, both in his walk and speech, for the pained
      look on Don's blackened but ghastly face told him at a glance that
      something more than ordinary was amiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly setting down the lantern, which he had all along retained in his
      grasp&mdash;most fortunately, as it turned out&mdash;Don threw himself on
      the trampled grass, and, as rapidly as his shortness of breath would
      permit, summed up the disastrous results of his village expedition. In
      open-mouthed silence, as was his wont, the old sailor listened; but when
      he learned of the dark uncertainty that overhung the fate of Jack and
      Puggles, he hastily brushed aside a tear that straggled down his
      weather-beaten cheek, and, in a voice husky with emotion, burst into one
      of his characteristic snatches of song:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Why, what's that to you if my eyes I'm a-wipin'?
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      A tear is a pleasure, d'ye see, in its way.
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      'Tis nonsense for trifles, I owns, to be pipin',
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      But they as hain't pily&mdash;why, I pities they!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And having delivered himself of this sailorly apology for his weakness, he
      added in his usual voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blow me!&mdash;as the speakin trumpet says to the skipper&mdash;if ever I
      heard any yarn as beats this 'un, lad. Howsomedever, when the ship's
      a-sinkin', pipin' your eye ain't a-goin' to stop the leak, d'ye mind me;
      an' so, just to bear away on the off tack a bit, what d'ye make o' this
      'ere confleegration, I axes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you better what it came jolly near making of me, captain, and
      that's cinders! But what do <i>you</i> make of it?&mdash;and, by the way,
      what were those shots for? You don't think there's any danger here, do
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; replied the captain, with an emphatic tug at his neckerchief, &ldquo;that
      I does, lad! An' why? you naterally axes. Because, d'ye mind me, the
      hill's ablaze from stem to starn&mdash;blow me if it bain t!
      Howsomedever,&rdquo; leading the way towards a jagged remnant of wall that stood
      out in ghostly solitude amid the ruins, &ldquo;go aloft an' cast an eye out to
      lee'ard, lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain's ominous words prepared Don for an unpleasant surprise; yet,
      when he had scaled the pile of masonry, an involuntary cry of alarm broke
      from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens, captain, we're surrounded by fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right, lad! an' the confleegration's gettin' uncommon clost under our
      weather bow; says you. An hour back, d'ye see, I sights the first on 'em
      alongside o' the path below, an' fires the gun to signal ye to put about.
      An' then, flush, my scuppers! what does I see but a hull sarcle o'
      confleegrations, as it may be a cable's len'th apart, clean round the
      hill; lad! an' so I fires the second wolley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the work of those cowardly niggers!&rdquo; said Don, clenching his
      fists. &ldquo;They daren't come here to fight us, so they mean to scorch us
      out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wery identical words as I says to myself when first I sights the
      fires, lad,&rdquo; rejoined the captain; &ldquo;an' a purty lot o' tobackie it cost me
      afore I overhauled the idee, says you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's likely to cost us more than a few pipes of tobacco, I'm afraid,
      captain,&rdquo; said Don uneasily, leaping down from his post of observation.
      &ldquo;The fire's close upon us, and once this grass catches, why, good-bye to
      the stores! I say, where's Spottie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belay there!&rdquo; chuckled the captain, who, somehow, seemed remarkably
      cheerful, considering the gravity of the situation. &ldquo;Whereaway's the
      nigger, you axes? Why, d'ye mind me, lad, this 'ere old hulk ain't been
      a-lyin' on her beam-ends all this time, not by a long chalk. The nigger's
      with the stores, d'ye see; an' stow my cargo, where should the stores be
      but safe and snug under hatches?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that he seized his perplexed companion by the arm, skirted the
      dilapidated wall, and presently halted on the very brink of a black chasm
      that yawned to the stars close under its rear. Little else was to be seen,
      for the wall cut off the light of both the fire and the moon. From the
      depths of the cavity proceeded a sound suspiciously like snoring. The
      captain indulged in another chuckle, and then, shaping his hands into a
      sort of speaking-trumpet, he bent over the hole and shouted loudly for
      Spottie. The snoring suddenly ceased, and in half a minute or so up the
      black tumbled, rubbing his eyes. The captain bade him fetch the lantern,
      adding strict injunctions that he should replenish the store of oil before
      lighting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, lad, let's go below,&rdquo; said he, when Spottie had fulfilled his
      mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      So down they went, the captain leading. First came a dozen or more
      moss-grown steps, littered with blocks of stone, which, ages before,
      perhaps, had fallen and found a resting-place here. At the foot of the
      steps there opened out a subterranean passage, of height sufficient to
      admit of Don's standing erect in it with ease. Upon the floor lay the
      stores; beyond these again all was blank darkness. To all appearance the
      passage extended far into the bowels of the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blow me!&rdquo; chuckled the captain, turning a triumphant gaze upon the
      massive walls, &ldquo;electric lightnin' itself ud never smell us out in sich a
      tidy berth as this, says you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly is a snug spot,&rdquo; assented Don; &ldquo;though I wish&rdquo;&mdash;glancing
      round at their sadly depleted numbers&mdash;&ldquo;I wish that Jack and Pug were
      as safe, poor fellows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up, my hearty. As I says afore, there's a Providence, lad, as sits
      up aloft to keep watch for the life of poor Jack.' Ay, an for the nigger's
      too, d'ye mind me, lad,&rdquo; rejoined the captain, blowing his nose loudly.
      &ldquo;So let's turn out an' see what manner o' headway the confleegrations
      makin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brief as was their absence from &ldquo;the glimpses of the moon,&rdquo; the fire had
      made alarming progress in the interval. Viewed from the centre of the
      swiftly-narrowing cordon of flame, the scene was awesome in the extreme.
      The rear column of the invader advanced the more slowly of the two, but
      even it was now within a stone's throw of that godsend, the captain's
      &ldquo;tidy berth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the seaward side the flames had overleapt the jungle's edge, and seized
      with unsated greed upon the luxuriant grass that everywhere grew amid the
      ruins. Nearer still, the dense, parasitic growth upon the remnant of wall,
      ignited by the dense clouds of sparks which the wind drove far ahead of
      the actual fire, was blazing fiercely. The heat was stifling; the air,
      choked with smoke and showers of glowing sparks, unbreathable. They
      retreated precipitately to the cooler shelter of the underground chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even here the noise of the flames could be distinctly heard. Indeed, they
      had been barely ten minutes below when the fiery sea rolled with a sullen
      roar over their heads, the fierce heat driving them back from the
      entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hours must pass before it would be either safe or practicable to
      venture into the open air. Accordingly, following the captain's example,
      Don made himself as comfortable for the night as circumstances permitted.
      A quantity of dried grass, which Spottie had thoughtfully collected and
      deposited beside the stores, afforded an excellent bed, and soon the deep
      breathing of all three told that sleep too had made this long untenanted
      nook her refuge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upwards of an hour had passed when a tremendous grinding crash shook the
      passage from roof to floor, and brought Don and the captain to their feet.
      They had fallen asleep surrounded by a subdued glow of firelight; they
      woke to find themselves in pitchy darkness. Bosin and the scarcely more
      courageous Spottie began to whimper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Avast there!&rdquo; the captain sang out at the latter. &ldquo;Is this a time to
      begin a-pipin' of your eye like a wench, I axes? Belay that, ye lubberly
      swab, an' light the binnacle lamp till we takes our bearin's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This order Spottie obeyed with an alacrity which, it is but due to him to
      explain, sprang rather from a dread of his master's heavy boot than from
      his fear of the dark. In the light thus thrown on the situation, the cause
      of the recent crash became only too apparent. So, too, did its effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ruined wall which overtopped their place of refuge had fallen,
      completely blocking the exit with huge stones, still glowing hot from the
      action of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Batten&mdash;my&mdash;hatches, lad!&rdquo; ejaculated the old sailor, as the
      full significance of the catastrophe flashed upon him. &ldquo;We're prisoners,
      says you!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.&mdash;INTO THE HEART OF THE HILL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here was no
      denying the truth of the captain's disconcerting announcement. So far as
      concerned the ancient flight of steps, egress from the underground chamber
      was wholly cut off. In the space of a single moment their refuge had
      become a prison. For, to begin with, the stones which blocked the entrance
      were glowing hot; while, to end with, these were of such a size, and so
      tightly wedged between the walls of the narrow opening, as to render any
      attempt at removing them, in the absence of suitable implements, utterly
      futile. If ever there existed a dilemma worthy the consumption of the
      captain's tobacco, here was one. The huge meerschaum was lighted
      forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      And never, perhaps, in all its long and varied history, did the pipe
      perform its task of &ldquo;'ilin' up&rdquo; the old sailors &ldquo;runnin' gear&rdquo; so promptly
      and satisfactorily as now. For scarcely had he taken half-a-dozen &ldquo;w'hiffs
      o' the fragrant,&rdquo; when, &ldquo;Blow me, lad!&rdquo; he exclaimed, triumphantly
      following with the stem of the pipe the course of a blue spiral which had
      just left his lips, &ldquo;d'ye see that, now? No sooner I lets it out than away
      it scuds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under other circumstances this observation would have sounded commonplace;
      here it was significant. The fragrant spiral, after wavering an instant as
      if uncertain what course to take, broke and floated slowly towards the
      wall of <i>débris</i> which blocked the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wery good!&rdquo; resumed the captain, when this became apparent; &ldquo;an' what o'
      that? you naterally axes. Why, do ye mind me, lad, when smoke sheers off
      to lee'ard in that 'ere fashion, it sinnifies a drorin'; and a drorin',
      dye see, sinnifies a current o' atmospheric air; and&mdash;as the
      maintop-gallan's'l says when it sights the squall&mdash;-blow me! if a
      current o' atmospheric air don't sinnify as this 'ere subterraneous
      ramification's got a venthole in it somewheres, d'ye see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, as for that,&rdquo; said Don, &ldquo;I noticed a draught drawing up the steps,
      as soon as I set foot on them. The entrance seemed to act like a sort of
      flue; and, come to think of it, it couldn't do that, in spite of the
      heated air above, unless there was an inlet somewhere below, could it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, inlet's the wery nautical tarm I was a-tryin' to overhaul, lad,&rdquo;
       replied the captain complacently. &ldquo;An'&mdash;shiver my binnacle!&mdash;for
      that inlet we runs. Legs we has, light we has!&mdash;so why not? I axes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More grope than run, I fancy,&rdquo; said Don, peering into the darkness of the
      tunnel. &ldquo;But there's no help for it, I suppose; though Heaven only knows
      where or what it may lead to! The stores, of course, remain here for the
      present; they're safe enough, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seizing the lantern, he led off without further parley. Spottie&mdash;haunted
      in the dark by an ever-pursuing fear of spooks&mdash;made a close second;
      while the old sailor brought up the rear with Bosin on his shoulder. Here
      and there a lizard, alarmed by the hollow echo of their footsteps, or by
      the glare of the passing light, scurried across their path.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a considerable distance the passage continued on the level, then
      dipped suddenly in a steep flight of steps. After this came other level
      bits, succeeded by other descents, the number of steps in each successive
      flight&mdash;or, rather, fall&mdash;increasing as they proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks as if we were bound for the foot of the hill,&rdquo; remarked Don,
      pausing to allow the captain to overtake him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' well I knows it, lad!&rdquo; replied that worthy, as he accomplished the
      descent of that particular flight of steps with a sigh of relief like the
      blowing of a small whale. &ldquo;Sleepin' in the open an' that, d'ye see, 's
      made my jints a bit stiff like&mdash;'specially the wooden one!
      Howsomedever, let's get on again&mdash;as the seaman says when the
      lubberly donkey rose by the starn an' hove him by the board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On they accordingly went, and down, the level intervals growing less and
      less frequent, the seemingly interminable tiers of steps more precipitous.
      Even the captain, level-headed old sailor though he was, detected himself
      in the act of clutching at the wall, so suggestive of utter bottomlessness
      was the black chasm yawning ever at their feet. The very echoes hurried
      back to them as if fearful of venturing the abysmal depths. What it would
      have been to have penetrated the tunnel without a lantern Don dared not
      think.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the roof and walls contracted until they seemed to press with an
      insupportable weight upon their shoulders. The steps, too, at first equal
      in height and even of surface, became irregular and slippery. Ooze of a
      vivid prismatic green glistened on either hand; water gathered in
      pellucid, elongated drops overhead, shivered for an instant as if startled
      by the unwonted light, then glinted noiselessly down upon the dank,
      mould-carpeted steps, which no human foot apparently had pressed for ages.
      Suppose their advance, when they got a little lower, should be cut off by
      the water, as retreat was already cut off by the fallen wall!
    </p>
    <p>
      A level footing at last! Twenty yards on through the darkness, and no
      steps. Had these come to an end? It almost seemed so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the captain stopped. On the rock floor a tiny pool shimmered like
      crystal in the lantern-light. He scooped up a little of the water in his
      broad palm and tasted it, &ldquo;Stave my water-butt, lad!&rdquo; cried he, smacking
      his lips with immense gusto. &ldquo;This 'ere aqueous fluid what's a-washin'
      round in the scuppers ain't no bilge-water, d'ye mind me! Reg'lar genewine
      old briny's what it is, an' well I knows the taste on it! We're under the
      crik&mdash;blow me if we bain't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shouldn't wonder,&rdquo; said Don, consulting his watch. &ldquo;It's now three
      o'clock; we've been on the grope just three-quarters of an hour. A jolly
      nice fix we'll be in if we reach daylight on the far side of the creek&mdash;with
      no means of crossing it, I mean. But wherever this mole-hole leads to,
      let's get to the end of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More steps, but this time ascending. The walls, too, became perceptibly
      drier, the narrow limits and musty air of the vaulted way less oppressive.
      With elastic steps and light hearts they pressed forward, assured that
      release was now close at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came sooner than they anticipated, for presently the tunnel veered
      sharply to the left, and as Don rounded the angle of wall a low, musical
      lapping of waves fell on his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain was right in his conjecture; the passage had conducted them
      directly under the creek, and it was on that side of the ravine
      immediately adjacent to the Elephant Rock that they now emerged into the
      fresh night air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the tunnel terminated in a platform of rock, escarped from the solid
      cliff, and draped by a curtain of vines similar to, though somewhat
      thinner than, that which concealed the hiding-place of the <i>Jolly Tar</i>.
      The platform itself lay wrapped in deepest shade, but through the
      interstices of the natural curtain overhanging it they could see the
      moonlight shimmering on the surface of the creek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blow me, lad!&rdquo; cried the captain, after peering about him for some
      seconds: &ldquo;this 'ere cove as we're hove-to in orter lay purty nigh abreast
      o' the <i>Jolly Tar</i>, says you. Belay that, ye lubber!&rdquo; making a dive
      after the monkey, who, with a shrill cry, had swung down from his shoulder
      and scuttled to the edge of the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don gripped the old sailor by the arm and forcibly held him back. &ldquo;Hist!&rdquo;
       he cried in suppressed, excited tones. &ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment of strained silence; then, from the direction of the creek came a
      faint plashing sound, such as might have been produced by the regular dip
      of paddles. Releasing his hold on the captain's arm, Don crossed the rocky
      floor on tiptoe, parted the trailing vines with cautious hand, and took a
      rapid survey of the moonlit creek. Then he hastily seized the monkey and
      darted back to the captains side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Canoes!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Two of them, packed with natives, and heading
      straight for us. Back into the passage! And, Spottie! douse that light.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.&mdash;RELATES HOW A WRONG ROAD LED TO THE RIGHT PLACE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hey had barely
      gained the shelter of the tunnel and extinguished the light, when the
      prows of the canoes grated against the rock, and a number of natives
      scrambled out upon the platform, jabbering loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would they remain there, or enter the tunnel where the little band of
      unarmed adventurers&mdash;for the captain had neglected to fetch a musket,
      and Don to load his pistols&mdash;lay concealed? It was a moment of
      breathless suspense. Then a torch was lighted, and 'the intruders, to the
      number of perhaps a score, filed off to the right and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the last echo of their footsteps had died away, the captain heaved a
      sigh of relief, and bade Spottie relight the lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I be afear'd o' the warmints, dye mind me, lad,&rdquo; said he, as if
      in apology for the sigh; &ldquo;only&mdash;spike my guns!&mdash;a couple o'
      brace o' fists 'ud be short rations to set under the noses o' sich a
      rampageous crew, d'ye see. Howsome-dever, the way's clear at last, as the
      shark says when he'd swallied the sailor; so beat up to wind'ard a bit,
      till we diskiver whereaway the warmints's bound for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's another passage, most likely,&rdquo; observed Don, holding the lantern
      aloft at arm's length as they left the tunnel behind and reemerged upon
      the rock platform. &ldquo;Ha! there it is, captain; yonder, in the far corner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right ye are, lad,&rdquo; replied the captain with a chuckle. &ldquo;We'll
      inwestigate into this 'ere subterraneous ramification, says you; so forge
      ahead, my hearty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The entrance to the second tunnel was quickly gained, and into it, as
      nothing was either to be seen or heard of the natives, they &ldquo;inwestigated&rdquo;&mdash;to
      use the captain's phraseology&mdash;-as far as a flight of steps which
      extended upwards for an unknown distance beyond the limits of the
      lantern's rays. Here the captain paused, and bending forward:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scrapers an' holystones, lad!&rdquo; cried he with a chuckle; &ldquo;the quarterdeck
      of a ship-o'-the-line itself ain't cleaner'n these 'ere steps. Native feet
      goin' aloft and a-comin' down continual, that's what's scraped 'em, says
      you; an' so I gets an idee. This 'ere subterraneous carawan as we've been
      an' diskivered is the tail o' the 'Elephant'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The what, captain?&rdquo; cried Don.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, d'ye mind me, lad,&rdquo; the captain proceeded to explain, &ldquo;when them
      lubberly land-swabs as pilots elephants&mdash;which I means mahouts, d'ye
      see&mdash;when they wants to go aloft, so to say, how does they manage the
      business? I axes. They lays hold on the warmint's tail, says you, and up
      they goes over the starn. Wery good! This 'ere's a Elephant Rock as we're
      at the present moment inwestigatin' into, d'ye mind me, an' when betimes
      the lubberly crew as mans it is ordered aloft onto the animile's back,
      why, up these 'ere steps they goes. An' so I calls 'em the tail o' the
      'Elephant'&mdash;an' why not? I axes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don gripped the old sailor's hand impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah! this discovery's worth a dozen hours' groping underground,
      captain!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;For if the natives can gain the Elephant Rock by
      following this passage, why can't we do the same? Jack, old boy, if you're
      still alive&mdash;which you are, please God!&mdash;we'll find you yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, at the risk of our wery lives, if need be!&rdquo; responded the captain, in
      tones that lost none of their heartiness through being a bit husky. &ldquo;An'
      the bag o' pearls, too, for the matter o' that, lad,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;for, d'ye
      see, as the old song says:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      We always be ready,

      We'll fight an' we'll conquer agin and agin!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howsomedever, fightin' without wittles ain't to be thought of, no more'n
      without powder, says you; so 'bout ship an' bear away for the Ha'nted
      Pagodas!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven for the fire and that tumbledown wall!&rdquo; ejaculated Don as
      they retraced their steps to the platform. &ldquo;Chance has done for us what no
      planning&mdash;or fighting either, for the matter of that&mdash;could ever
      have done. We started on a wrong road, but, all the same, it has led us to
      the right place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, lad, only chance bain't the right word for it, d'ye see. There's a
      Providence, lad, as sits up aloft,&rdquo; said the captain, lifting his cap
      reverently. &ldquo;I bain't, so to say, a religious cove; but, storm or calm,
      them's the wery identical words as I always writes in my log. An', d'ye
      mind me, lad, 'tis the hand o' the Good Pilot as has guided us here
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't doubt it,&rdquo; replied Don gravely, &ldquo;any more than I doubt that the
      same Good Pilot will guide us safely into port. Bearing that in mind, we
      have only to mature our plans and end the whole thing at a stroke. Here we
      are, and now for the creek,&rdquo; he concluded, crossing the platform and
      thrusting aside the pendent vines. &ldquo;We'll borrow one of the canoes those
      niggers came in. Hullo, they're gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of the lubberly crew stopped aboard and rowed off agin, belike,&rdquo;
       observed the captain. &ldquo;Blow me, if we shan't have to take to the water, as
      the sailors said when they'd swallied all the rum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don made no reply, but rapidly divesting himself of his coat and shoes, he
      slipped into the water before the old sailor well knew what he was about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm off for the canoe we hid in the jungle,&rdquo; he called back as he struck
      out for the other shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, lad!&rdquo; responded the captain; &ldquo;an' here's to your speedy retarn,
      as the shark says when they hoisted the sailor into the ship's gig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Swimming the creek was, after all, an insignificant feat for a
      sturdy-limbed young fellow like Don. The water was warm and refreshing,
      the distance far from great. A dozen vigorous strokes, and he was well
      within the deep shadow of the opposite cliff, for he deemed it prudent to
      avoid the moonlight, lest by any chance the natives who had removed the
      canoes should be in the vicinity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, indeed, he fancied he actually heard a faint splashing in the water
      a short distance ahead. He floated for a moment, motionless and alert; but
      as the noise was not repeated, he swam on again. He had made scarce
      half-a-dozen strokes, however, when he suddenly felt himself gripped from
      below by the leg. His first thought was of sharks; his next, that he was
      in the clutches of a human foe, for a vice-like hand was at his throat.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;CAPTAIN MANGO &ldquo;GOES ALOFT.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>elf-preservation
      is the first law of life, and no sooner did Don feel that iron grip
      compressing his throat, and dragging him down into the depths of the
      creep, than he struck out to such good purpose that the hold of his
      unknown assailant quickly relaxed. As he shot up to the surface he found
      himself confronted by the dripping head and shoulders of a native. A brief
      cessation of hostilities followed; each glared at the other defiantly, the
      native's tense breathing and watchful eye indicating that, though baffled
      for the moment by his opponents prompt defensive measures, he was in no
      two minds about renewing the struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, by a lightning-like movement of the hand, he dashed a blinding
      jet of spray into Don's eyes, instantly followed up the advantage thus
      treacherously gained, grappled with him, and pinioned his arms tightly at
      his sides. Then, to his horror, Don felt his head thrust violently back,
      felt the fellow's hot, quick breath on his neck, and his teeth gnashing
      savagely at his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily for himself Don was no mean athlete, and knew how to use his fists
      to advantage when occasion demanded. Wrenching his arms free, he seized
      the native by the throat, and in spite of his eel-like slipperiness and
      desperate struggles, by an almost superhuman effort forced him slowly
      backwards until he had him at effective striking distance, when, suddenly
      loosing his hold, he let him have a tremendous &ldquo;one-two&rdquo; straight from the
      shoulder, that stretched the native senseless and bleeding on the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would have it!&rdquo; he panted, surveying the native's sinewy proportions
      with grim satisfaction. &ldquo;Next time you won't wait to be knocked out, I
      reckon. But 'twon't do to let you drown, though you richly deserve it; so
      come along, you black cub!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Seizing the black by the convenient tuft of hair at the back of his
      bullet-head, he towed him to the strip of beach, and there hauled him out
      upon the sand, directly into a patch of moonlight, as it happened, that
      came slanting down through a rift in the canopy of palm-leaves overhead.
      Something in the appearance of the upturned features caused him to drop on
      his knees at the natives side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he cried, peering into the fellow's face, &ldquo;Jack's lascar, as I'm
      alive! By Jove, you are a prize! We'll keep you with us longer than we did
      last time, my friend. Ha, ha! won't the captain chuckle, though!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With his belt he proceeded to strap the lascar's hands securely behind his
      back; but when it came to fastening his legs, a difficulty cropped up.
      That is to say, the strap could not be used for both, and he had no
      substitute. Fortunately the lascar wore about his loins the regulation
      length of strong country cotton&mdash;his only covering&mdash;and this Don
      was in the act of removing when a knife fell out of its folds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky thing I didn't run against you in the water,&rdquo; he soliloquised,
      picking the weapon up. &ldquo;Why, it's the very knife the lascar shot at Jack
      from the schooner's deck; the one he let the fellow have back for sending
      the boathook through the cutter's side; and that we afterwards found lying
      in the <i>ballam</i> here. And yet Jack certainly had it on him when those
      niggers carried him off. So, old chap,&rdquo; apostrophising the insensible
      owner of the much-bandied knife, &ldquo;so you had a hand in kidnapping him too,
      had you? All the more reason for caring for you now that we've got you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Following up this idea, he knotted the cloth tightly about the lascar's
      legs, dragged him well up the beach, and went in search of the canoe.
      This, fortunately, had not been molested in their absence; in a few
      minutes he had it in the water. Then, seizing the paddle, he propelled the
      light skiff swiftly in the direction of the rock platform, where he found
      the old sailor stumping his beat in a terrible state of uneasiness over
      his prolonged absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spike my guns, lad!&rdquo; cried he, bearing down upon the young man with
      outstretched hand and a smile as broad as the cutter's mainsail, &ldquo;they
      warmints's been an' done for Master Don this hitch, I says to myself when
      the half-hour fails to bring ye. An' what manner o' mishap's kept ye
      broached-to all this while? I axes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fact is, captain, I was attacked by the enemy. Came within an ace of
      being captured, too. But, as good luck would have it, I managed to get in
      a thundering broadside, boarded the enemy&mdash;there was only one,
      luckily&mdash;spiked his guns, and towed him ashore, where he's waiting to
      pay his respects to you now. But get in and see for yourself what a
      valuable prize I've taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain got in with all despatch, and, as soon as the canoe touched
      the opposite beach, got out again without delay, so eager was he to
      inspect, the captive. As it was now daylight, he recognised the fellow the
      moment he set eyes on him. His delight knew no bounds. Bound and round the
      luckless lascar he stumped, chuckling as he always did when he was
      pleased, and every now and then prodding him in the ribs with his wooden
      leg, as if to reassure himself that he laboured under no delusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sharks an' sea-sarpents, lad!&rdquo; he roared, when quite satisfied as to the
      lascar's identity, &ldquo;we'll keep the warmint fast in the bilboes a while,
      says you; for, d'ye mind me, he's old Salambo's right-hand man, is this
      lubber, as comes an' goes at his beck an' call, an' executes the orders as
      he gives. So in the bilboes he remains; why not? I axes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My idea precisely, captain. He can't be up to any of his little games so
      long as he has a good stout strap to hug him; and, what's more, he'll have
      a capital chance to recover from that nasty slash Jack gave him the other
      night. By the way, I've often wondered, do you know, how he managed to
      pull through that affair so easily. Suppose we turn him over and have a
      look at his shoulder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No sooner said than done, notwithstanding the captive's snarling protests;
      but, to their great amazement, his shoulder showed neither wound nor scar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this beats me!&rdquo; exclaimed Don incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' is this the wery identical swab, an' no mistake? I axes,&rdquo; demanded
      the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mistake? None whatever, unless Jack was mistaken in the fellow the other
      day, which isn't at all likely. Besides, I've seen him twice before
      myself; once in the temple, and again on the sands here. I'd know that
      hang-dog look of his among a thousand. Then there's Spottie; he saw him as
      well. Stop! let's see what Spottie makes of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spottie was summoned, and, without being informed of the point in dispute,
      unhesitatingly identified the captive as the lascar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Don, &ldquo;Jack must have supposed he stabbed the fellow when he
      didn't; that's the most I can make of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belay there!&rdquo; objected the captain. &ldquo;What about the blood in the canoe
      and on the knife when arterwards found? I axes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you have me. This fellow's the lascar fast enough; but how he's the
      lascar and yet doesn't show the wound Jack gave him, I know no more than
      the man in the moon. Ugh! what a greasy beast he is! I'd better take the
      strap up another hole to make sure of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, for a time, the puzzling question of the lascar's identity dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      No food being procurable here, they decided to push oh to the Haunted
      Pagodas ere the sun became too hot, and there endeavour to clear a passage
      to the immured stores. Accordingly, when the canoe had been dragged back
      to its former place of concealment, they set out, Don taking charge of the
      lascar, who, clad in Spottie's upper-cloth, and having his legs only at
      liberty, led as quietly as a lamb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two-thirds of the way up they came upon that portion of the hill which had
      been ravaged by the fire. For the most part this had now burnt itself out,
      leaving the summit of the elevation one vast bed of ghastly gray ashes,
      with here and there a smouldering stump or cluster of bamboo stems still
      smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Haunted Pagodas two surprises awaited them. The first of these was
      no other than Puggles himself, alive and lachrymose. On the floor of the
      otherwise empty &ldquo;fo'csle&rdquo; he sat, blubbering dolefully. Comical indeed was
      the spectacle he presented, with his woebegone face thickly begrimed with
      a mixture of ashes and tears&mdash;a sort of fortuitous whitewash,
      relieved in the funniest fashion by the black skin showing in patches
      through its lighter veneer, and by the double line of vivid red,
      stretching half-way from ear to ear, that marked the generous expanse of
      his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The explanation of his sudden disappearance proved simple enough. He had
      stumbled in the very act of following his master past the
      swiftly-advancing fire, and crawling back on hands and knees to a place of
      safety, had there passed the night alone in the jungle. On reaching the
      encampment and finding it deserted, he jumped to the conclusion that the
      fire had, as he put it, &ldquo;done eat sahibs up,&rdquo; stores and all. Hence his
      tearful condition on their return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second surprise was one of an equally pleasing nature, since it
      concerned the stores. The mass of <i>debris</i> which blocked the tunnel's
      mouth had subsided to such an extent in cooling as to admit of their
      reaching the imprisoned stores with but little difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same, captain,&rdquo; remarked Don, when presently they began a
      vigorous attack on the provisions, &ldquo;I'm jolly glad our fear of being
      buried alive drove us to the far end of the hole. We've got the key to the
      Elephant Rock, and, what's more, we've got a grip on old Salambo's right
      hand,&rdquo; nodding towards the lascar, who was again bound hand and foot,
      &ldquo;that's safe to stand us in good stead when it comes to the final tussle
      for Jack and the pearls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right ye are, lad,&rdquo; said the captain in tones as hearty as his appetite;
      &ldquo;an', blow me!&mdash;as the fog-horn says to the donkey-ingin&mdash;arter
      we snatches a wink o' sleep, d'ye mind me, we'll lay our heads together a
      bit an' detarmine on the best course to be steered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the stone floor of the &ldquo;fo'csle&rdquo; the blacks were already sleeping the
      sleep of repletion; and, their meal finished, Don and the captain lost no
      time in following their example&mdash;for thirty-six hours of almost
      unremitting exertion and danger had told heavily upon their powers of
      endurance. Dead tired as they were, they gave little heed to the lascar
      beyond assuring themselves by a hasty glance that his bonds were secure.
      To all appearance he was wrapped in profound slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was at the zenith when they stretched themselves upon the flags of
      the &ldquo;fo'csle&rdquo;; slowly it burnt its way downward to the western horizon,
      and still they slept. Don was the first to stir. He raised himself upon
      his elbow with a yawn, rubbed his eyes, gazed about him in momentary
      bewilderment. Twilight had already crept out of the ravine and invaded the
      ghostly, fire-scathed ruins. This was the first-thing he noticed. Then the
      recollection of the events of the past day and night rushed upon him, and
      he turned abruptly, with a sudden vague sense of dread, to the spot where
      the lascar lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lay? No; that place was empty!
    </p>
    <p>
      He could scarcely believe the evidence of his senses. Had the fellow
      somehow managed to shift his position, and roll out of sight behind one of
      the numerous blocks of stone that lay about? Or had he&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a cry of alarm he threw himself upon an object that lay where the
      lascar had lain. It was the leathern belt with which he had bound the
      fellow's arms. The tongue of the buckle was broken. He recollected now,
      and almost cursed his folly for not recollecting before, that the buckle
      had long been weak. Too late! The lascar had escaped!
    </p>
    <p>
      Dashing the traitorous belt upon the stones, he hurried to where the old
      sailor lay asleep, with Bosin curled up by his side, and shook him roughly
      by the shoulder. He was in no gentle mood just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain! Captain! Wake up! The lascars off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No response. No movement. Only the monkey awoke suddenly and fell to
      whimpering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain lay at full length upon his back, his bronzed hands clasped
      upon his broad chest, his blue sailor's cap drawn well over his eyes.
      Something in the pose of the figure at his feet, in its stillness&mdash;something,
      too, in the plaintive half-human wail the monkey uttered at the moment&mdash;struck
      a sudden chill to Don's heart. He dropped upon his knees, lifted the cap,
      peered into the upturned face. It was distorted, purple. He started back
      with a fearful cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not dead! Oh, my God, not dead!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.&mdash;SHROUDED IN A HAMMOCK.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hat was a fearful
      moment for Don. The quest of the golden pearl, entered upon with all the
      love of adventure and sanguine hope natural to young hearts, began to wear
      a serious aspect indeed. Even had Jack been there to share the heartbreak
      of it, this sudden, numbing blow would still have been terribly hard to
      bear. But Jack was gone&mdash;whither, Heaven alone knew&mdash;and the
      captain was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ay, the &ldquo;Providence that sits up aloft&rdquo; had at last looked out a snug
      berth for the old sailor, and shipped him for the Eternal Voyage. Kneeling
      by his side in the solemn twilight, with aching heart Don recalled all his
      quaint ways and quainter sayings, his large-hearted generosity, his
      rollicking good-nature, his rough but ever-ready sympathy&mdash;and sealed
      the kindly eyes with such tears as are wrung from us but once or twice in
      a lifetime, and recalled with sadness often, with shame never.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for him the captain would never have undertaken this disastrous
      venture. This was the bitterest, the sorest thought of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Bosin's low wailing broke in upon his sad reverie. Well-nigh human
      did the monkey seem, as with tender, lingering touch he caressed his
      master's face, and sought to rouse him from this strange sleep of which he
      felt but could not understand the awful meaning. Then, failing to win from
      the dumb lips the response he craved, he turned his eyes upon his master's
      friend with a look of pathetic appeal fairly heartbreaking in its mute
      intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner did he succeed in attracting Don's attention, however, than his
      manner underwent a complete change. The plaintive wail became a hiss, the
      puny, lithe hands tore frantically at something that showed like a thin,
      dark streak about the dead man's neck. What with the waning light and the
      shock of finding the captain dead, Don had not noticed this streak before.
      He looked at it closely now, and as he looked a horrified intelligence
      leapt into his face. The dark streak was a cord: the captain had been
      strangled!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the horror of that discovery! Hitherto he had suspected no foul play,
      no connection of any kind, indeed, between the captain's death and the
      lascar's escape; for had he not taken the precaution to disarm the native?
      But now he remembered seeing that cord about the fellow's middle. He had
      thought it harmless. Harmless! Ah, how different was the mute witness
      borne by the old sailor's lifeless form! In the lascar's hands the cord
      had proved an instrument of death as swift and sure as any knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why had the captain been singled out as the victim? Was the lascar
      merely bent on wreaking vengeance on those who had injured him? Or was he
      a tool in other and invisible hands?
    </p>
    <p>
      Feverishly he asked himself these questions as he removed the fatal cord,
      and composed the distorted features into a semblance of what they had been
      in life; asked, but could not answer them. Only, back of the whole
      terrible business, he seemed to see the cunning, unscrupulous
      shark-charmer, bent on retaining the pearls at any cost, fanning the
      lascar's hatred into fiercer flame, guiding his ready hand in its work of
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could he, alone and all but unaided, cope with the cunning of this enemy
      who, while himself unseen, made his devilish power felt at every turn? The
      responsibility thrown upon his shoulders by the captain's murder involved
      other and weightier issues than the mere recovery of a few thousand
      pounds' worth of stolen pearls. Jack must be rescued, if indeed he was
      still alive; while, if he too was dead, his and the captain's murderers
      must be brought to justice. This was the task before him; no light one for
      a youth of eighteen, with only a brace of timid native servants at his
      back. Yet he addressed himself to it with all the passionate determination
      born of his love for the chum and his grief for the friend who had stood
      by him &ldquo;through thick and thin.&rdquo; There was no hesitation, no wavering. &ldquo;Do
      or die!&rdquo; It was come to that now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain's burial must be his first consideration; for Don had lived
      long enough in the East to know how remorseless is the climate in its
      treatment of the dead. Morning at the latest must snatch the old sailor's
      familiar form for ever from his sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tarpaulin lay in the &ldquo;fo'csle,&rdquo; and with this he determined to hide the
      lascar's dread handiwork from view before waking the blacks, who still
      slept. While he was disposing this appropriate pall above the corpse, the
      captain's jacket fell open, and in an inside pocket he caught sight of a
      small volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he has papers about him that ought to be preserved,&rdquo; thought Don.
      &ldquo;I'll have a look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drawing the volume from its resting-place with reverent touch, he found it
      to be a copy of the Book of Common Prayer, sadly worn and battered, like
      its owner, by long service. Here and there a leaf was turned down, or a
      passage marked by the dent of a heavy thumb-nail&mdash;the sailor's
      pencil. But what arrested his attention were these words written on the
      yellow fly-leaf in a bold, irregular hand, and in ink so faded as to make
      it evident that many years had elapsed since they were penned:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To all and sundry as sights these lines, when-somedever it may please the
      Good Skipper to tow this 'ere old hulk safe into port, widelicit. If so be
      as I'm spared to go aloft when on the high-seas, wery good! the loan of a
      hammock and a bit o' ballast is all I axes. But if so be as I'm ewentually
      stranded on shore, why then, d'ye mind me, who-somedever ye be as sights
      these 'ere lines, I ain't to be battened down like a lubberly landsman,
      d'ye see, but warped off-shore an' shipped for the Eternal V'yage as a
      true seaman had ought to be. And may God have mercy on my soul.&mdash;Amen.
      The last Log and Testament of me,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;(Signed) John Mango, A.B.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The faded characters grew blurred and misty before Don's eyes as he
      scanned them. Closing the book, he grasped the captain's cold hand
      impulsively, and in tones choked with emotion, cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have your wish, dear old friend! We'll warp you off-shore and
      ship you for the Eternal Voyage in a way befitting the true seaman that
      you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the mute lips seemed to smile back their approval, as though they
      would say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, ay, wrhy not, I axes? An' cheer up, my hearty, for, d'ye mind me,
      lad, pipin' your eye won't stop the leak when the ship's a-sinkin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What boots it to linger over the noisy, but none the less genuine grief,
      of the faithful Spottie when he learned the sad truth? Nor is it necessary
      to describe at length the sad preparations for consigning the dead captain
      to his long home beneath the waves that had been his home so long in life.
      Suffice it to say that without loss of time a rude bier was constructed on
      which to convey the remains to the beach, and that while this was
      preparing there occurred an event so remarkable, and withal of so
      important a bearing upon the future of the quest, as to merit something
      more than mere passing mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened while the three were in the jungle cutting materials for the
      litter, and it concerned the fatal cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until the lascar's paid out, I'll keep this as a reminder of what I owe
      him,&rdquo; Don had said grimly, just before starting; and taking the lascars
      knife from his belt he stuck it into a crevice in the &ldquo;fo'csle&rdquo; wall, and
      hung the snake-like cord upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spottie and Puggles being too timid to leave with the dead, or to send
      alone into the jungle in quest of materials for the bier&mdash;for was it
      not at nightfall that shadowy spooks walked abroad?&mdash;Don was forced
      to bear them company. There was no help for it; the captain's body must be
      left unguarded in their absence&mdash;except, indeed, for such watch-care
      as puny Bosin was able to give it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to the moment of their setting out the monkey had not for a single
      instant left his master's side. This fact served to render all the more
      extraordinary the discovery they made on their return&mdash;namely, that
      the monkey had quitted his post. What could have induced him to abandon
      his master at such a moment was a mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the mystery deepened when Don, wanting the knife, sought it in the
      &ldquo;fo'csle,&rdquo; for, to his astonishment, neither knife nor cord was to be
      found.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dey spooks done steal urn, sar,&rdquo; cried Spottie, with chattering teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; objected Puggles, between whom and Spottie there had grown up a
      sharp rivalry during their brief acquaintance, &ldquo;why they no steal dead
      sahib? I axes.&rdquo; Then to his master: &ldquo;Lascar maybe done come back, sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This suggestion certainly smacked more of plausibility than that offered
      by Spottie, since it not only accounted for the disappearance of the cord
      and knife, but of Bosin as well. Was it too much to believe that the
      faithful creature's hatred, instinctively awakened by the lascar's
      stealthy return, had outweighed affection for his dead master and impelled
      him to abandon the one that he might track the other? Remembering the
      intelligence exhibited by the monkey in the past, Don at least was
      satisfied that this explanation was the true one.
    </p>
    <p>
      By midnight all was in readiness, and with heavy hearts they took up their
      dead and began the toilsome descent to the creek. This reached, the <i>Jolly
      Tar</i> was drawn from her place of concealment, and the captain's body
      lashed in a tarpaulin. Then, with white wings spread, the cutter bore
      silently away from the creek's mouth in quest of a last resting-place for
      the master whose behest she was never again to obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will do,&rdquo; said Don, when a half-hour's run had put them well
      off-shore. &ldquo;Take the tiller, Pug, and keep her head to the wind for a
      little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With bowed head he opened the well-worn Prayer Book, and, while the waves
      chanted a solemn funeral dirge, read in hushed tones the office for the
      burial of the dead at sea. A pause, a tear glinting in the moonlight, a
      splash&mdash;and just as the morning star flashed out like a beacon above
      the eastern sea-rim, the old sailor began the Eternal Voyage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Don, as he brought the cutters head round in the direction
      of the creek; &ldquo;now for the last tussle and justice for the dead. Let me
      only come face to face once more with that murderous lascar or his master,
      and no false notions of mercy shall stay my hand&mdash;so help me Heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And surely not Heaven itself could deem that vow unrighteous.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.&mdash;THE CROCODILE PIT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he last melancholy
      duty to the captain discharged, Don threw himself heart and fist&mdash;as
      Jack would have said&mdash;into the work cut out for him; and by the time
      the <i>Jolly Tar</i> was again rubbing her nose against the inner wall of
      the grotto, he had decided to abandon the Haunted Pagodas and to make this
      secluded spot&mdash;next door to the back entrance of the Elephant Rock&mdash;his
      base of operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up to now it's been all take and no give,&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;but now
      we've got to act, and act like a steel trap, sharp and sure. What is it
      the old school motto says?&mdash;'<i>bis dat qui cito dat</i>,' 'a quick
      blow's as good as two any day.' The old Roman who strung that together
      knew what he was talking about, anyhow, and I'll put his old saw to the
      test before another sun sets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the letter of which Bosin had been the bearer Jack had said&mdash;&ldquo;They
      take me to the Elephant Rock to-night.&rdquo; Twice since then had night come
      and gone; and if his chum had not perished in the village holocaust, in
      the Elephant Rock he was probably to be found. Hurrah for the finding!
    </p>
    <p>
      The muskets were still at the &ldquo;fo'csle,&rdquo; for that sad midnight descent of
      the hill had left their hands too full for weapons. Besides, none were
      needed then. They were needed now, however, so there was nothing for it
      but to climb the hill after them. This, and the time necessarily consumed
      in snatching a hasty meal, delayed the start by a good two hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length all was ready, and tumbling into the canoe they pushed off. To
      stick to the literal truth, Spottie did the tumbling. In spite of all his
      efforts to assume a dignity of carriage in keeping with his weapons and
      the occasion, the cutlass at Spottie's belt would persist in getting at
      crosspurposes with his long, thin legs, and so throw him, physically
      speaking, off his balance. Once seated in the canoe, however, with the
      point of the cutlass in dangerous proximity to Puggles's back, and the old
      flint-lock so disposed upon his knees as to hit Don to a dead certainty if
      by any mischance it went off, Spottie looked exceedingly fierce&mdash;in
      fact, an out-and-out swashbuckler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so Puggles. No weapons could make him look other than what nature had
      made him&mdash;a happy-go-lucky, fun-and-food loving, sunny-faced lump of
      oily blackness. The extra broad grin that tugged at the far corners of bis
      expansive mouth proclaimed him at peace with all the world&mdash;especially
      with that important section of it bounded by his swelling waistband&mdash;and
      gave the lie direct to his warlike equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of crossing the creek Don made short work, and soon they stood upon the
      rock platform, where, but little more than twenty-four hours before, the
      landing and sudden disappearance of the native crew had put them in
      possession of the key which was now, if fortune favoured them, to unlock
      the secret of Jack's fate, and, haply, the door of his prison-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yonder on the right&mdash;for the spot was light enough by day, despite
      its curtain of vegetation&mdash;could be seen the black mouth of the
      tunnel running under the creek, and so to the summit of Haunted Pagoda
      Hill; here, on the left, that by which the natives had taken their
      departure. It was with this that Don's business lay now; and as he led the
      way into it he recalled with a sorrowful smile that quaint fancy of the
      captain's which made this approach to the Rook &ldquo;the tail o' the Elephant.&rdquo;
       And here was the very spot where he had uttered the words. He almost
      fancied he could see the old sailor standing there still, his wooden leg
      thrust well forward, his cap well back, and Bosin perched contentedly upon
      his broad shoulder. Alas for fancy!
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was this that came leaping down the dim vista of steps? No
      creature of fancy surely, but actual flesh and blood. Only flesh and blood
      in the form of a monkey, it is true, but what mattered that, since the
      monkey was none other than Bosin himself?
    </p>
    <p>
      A jubilant shout from Puggles greeted his appearance&mdash;a shout which
      Don, fearful of discovery, immediately checked&mdash;while Spottie made as
      if to catch the returned truant. But the impish Bosin would have none of
      him; eluding the grasp of the black, he sprang upon Don's shoulder. Only
      then did Don observe that the monkey was not empty-handed. He carried
      something hugged tightly against his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like all his tribe, Bosin had a pretty <i>penchant</i> for annexing any
      chance article that happened to take his fancy, without regard to ordinary
      rights of property.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prigging again, eh?&rdquo; said Don, as he gently disengaged the monkey's booty
      from his grasp. &ldquo;What have you got this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To his astonishment he saw that he held in his hands the lascar's cord,
      and&mdash;surely he was not mistaken?&mdash;the fellow to that half of
      Jack's handkerchief in which his letter had been wrapped up when
      despatched from the village per monkey post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bosin's mysterious disappearance, then, was explained. In quitting his
      dead master's side so unaccountably he had had a purpose in view&mdash;a
      monkeyish, unreasoning purpose, doubtless, but none the less a purpose&mdash;which
      was none other than to track the lascar to his lair and regain possession
      of the cord. Not that he knew in the least the value to Don of the yard of
      twisted hemp, or the significance of the scrap of crumpled, bloodstained
      cambric he was at such pains to filch. With only blind instinct for his
      guide, he had been guided better than he knew; for while the cord proved
      the Elephant Rock to be the hiding-place of the lascar, the handkerchief
      proved, or seemed to prove, that Jack was still alive and that the
      lascar's hiding-place was his prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don's heart leapt at the discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Jack, unable for some reason to scribble even so much as a word,
      had entrusted the handkerchief to the monkey's care, knowing that the
      sight of it would assure his chum of his safety, if it did no more. Or
      perhaps Bosin had carried it off while Jack slept?
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand conjectures flashed through Don's brain, but he thrust them
      hastily aside, since mere conjecture could not release his chum; and
      calling to the blacks to follow, he sprang up the steps with a lighter
      heart. The monkey swung himself down from his perch and took the lead, as
      if instinctively divining the object of their quest; chattering gleefully
      when the trio pressed close upon his heels&mdash;impatiently when they
      lagged behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steps surmounted, they discovered an offshoot from the main tunnel,
      from which point of division the latter dwindled straight away into a mere
      dot of light in the distance. In the main tunnel itself the light was
      faint enough; but as they advanced it increased in brilliancy till
      presently&mdash;the distance being actually much less than the unbroken
      perspective of chiselled rock made it appear&mdash;they emerged suddenly
      into the broad light of day, streaming down through an oblong cleft or
      gash cut deep into the solid heart of the Rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light itself was more welcome than what it revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Directly across their path, at their very feet indeed, extended a yawning
      chasm, of depth unknown&mdash;but, as the first glance served to show, of
      such breadth as to effectually bar their further progress.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.&mdash;DON SETS A DEATH-TRAP FOR THE LASCAR.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>o be sure,
      skirting the end wall on the extreme left was a ledge along which the
      agile monkey made his way to the opposite side of the pit with little or
      no difficulty; but, as for following him, by that road at least, why, the
      thing was an utter impossibility. The ledge was a mere thread. Scarce a
      handbreadth of rock lay between the smooth-cut upper wall and the
      perpendicular face of the pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blow me!&rdquo; muttered Don, unconsciously echoing the phrase he had so often
      heard on the captains lips, &ldquo;if this ain't the purtiest go as ever I see!&rdquo;
       Which assertion was purely figurative; for as he was only too well aware
      it was &ldquo;no go&rdquo; at all, so far as the pit was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peering over the brink of the chasm he found it to be partially filled
      with water, between which and the spot where he stood intervened perhaps
      thirty feet of sheer wall. An uninviting pool it looked, lying as green
      and putrescent within its sunken basin as if the bones of unnumbered dead
      men were rotting in its depths. The very sunshine that fell in great
      golden blotch upon its surface seemed to shrink from its foul touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what struck Don as the strangest feature of this noisome pool was the
      constant agitation of its waters. To what was it due? What were those
      black, glistening objects floating here and there upon its surface? And
      those others, ranged along the half-submerged ledge on the far side? A
      small fragment of stone chanced to lie near him. He picked it up and aimed
      it at one of these curious objects. To his astonishment the black mass
      slowly shifted its position and plunged with a wallowing splash into the
      pool. Puggles, who had been looking on with mouth agape, raised a shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him corkadile, sa'b! Me sometimes bery often seeing um in riber. Him
      plenty appetite got!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh, the monsters!&rdquo; muttered his master, watching with a sort of horrible
      fascination the movements of the hulking reptiles, which lifted their
      ugly, square snouts towards him as if scenting prey. &ldquo;Here's a pretty
      kettle of fish! Crossing this hole is hound to be a tough job at the best&mdash;but,
      as if that wasn't enough, these brutes must turn up and add danger to
      difficulty. Plenty appetite? I should think so, indeed, in such a hole as
      this! However, crocodile or no crocodile, it's got to be crossed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Until now he had rather wondered, to tell the truth, why it was that not a
      single native had crossed their path. He had expected to find the passage
      guarded. The pit, not to say the crocodiles, shed a flood of light&mdash;not
      very cheering light, he was forced to admit&mdash;upon this point. No
      doubt the natives considered themselves in little danger from intrusion,
      so long as they were guarded by a dozen feet of sheer pit, with a dozen
      brace or so of healthy crocodiles at the bottom of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And probably they were right so far as concerned intruders of their own
      colour and pluck; but Don was made of sturdier stuff than native clay.
      Beyond the crocodile pit lay his chum, a prisoner. Cross it he must, and
      would. Therefore, to borrow the expressive phrase of an American humorist,
      he &ldquo;rose to the emergency and caved the emergency's head in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was the pit too wide to leap? Spanning it with his eye, he estimated its
      width at a dozen feet; certainly not less. A tremendous leap that, and
      fraught with fearful risk. And even should he be able to take it, what of
      Spottie and Puggles? They would never dare face it. And what, too, of the
      muskets and cutlasses?
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he descried, just where the continuation of the tunnel pierced
      the wall on the far side of the pit, an object that inspired him with
      fresh hope and determination. True, it was nothing more than a plank, but
      once that plank was in his hands, he could, perhaps, bridge the pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dozen feet at the very least! Could he clear it? To jump short of the
      opposite ledge, to reach it, even, and then slip, meant certain and
      horrible death at the jaws of the crocodiles. Should he venture? Jack had
      ventured much for him. He slipped off his shoes&mdash;his stockinged feet
      would afford a surer foothold&mdash;and quietly bade the blacks stand
      aside. Sauntering carelessly into the tunnel&mdash;that by which they had
      approached the pit&mdash;a distance of forty paces or so, he turned, drew
      a deep breath, threw all his lithe strength into the short run, his whole
      soul into the leap, and&mdash;&mdash; Would he clear it?
    </p>
    <p>
      No&mdash;yes! A horrified shriek from the blacks, and he was over, the pit
      a scant handbreadth behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragging the plank from its place of partial concealment, he was delighted
      to find a short piece of rope attached to it. Good; it would facilitate
      the bridging of the chasm. Standing on the brink, he coiled the rope&mdash;not
      without a misgiving that it was too short for his purpose&mdash;and,
      calling to Spottie to catch the end, threw it out over the pit
      sailor-fashion. It fell short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;This will make it right;&rdquo; and drawing the lascar's cord
      from his pocket, he knotted it to the rope. This time Spottie succeeded in
      grasping the end; and so, with the aid of the lascar's cord, the plank was
      drawn across. Its length was such that it bridged the pit from wall to
      wall, with a foot of spring-way to spare at either end.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time Don thought nothing of this apparently trivial incident; yet,
      had he but known it, with that cord he had laid a death-trap for
      the-captain's murderer.

      In five minutes the blacks had crawled across, with many fearful glances
      at the upturned snouts of the huge reptiles below; and Don, treading the
      springy length of plank with sure foot, had transferred muskets and
      cutlasses to what he mentally termed &ldquo;Jack's side&rdquo; of the chasm. They were
      now ready for a fresh start.

      All this time Bosin had watched their movements with an expression of
      mingled shrewdness and approval in his restless eyes that seemed to say:
      &ldquo;Ha! the very thing I'd do myself were I in the fix you're in.&rdquo; Again he

      His knowledge of the way became more apparent still when, after
      penetrating the heart of the rock for some distance, the tunnel split into
      three distinct branches. This point Don hesitated to pass; but not so
      Bosin. Without a pause he took the passage to the right, glancing back as
      if to assure himself that he was followed. Off this gallery others opened,
      until it became evident that, as the captain had once affirmed, the rock
      was honeycombed &ldquo;from maindeck to keelson.&rdquo; But for the monkey's guidance
      Don must have found himself utterly at a loss amid so perplexing a
      labyrinth. As it was, he pressed forward with confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Danger of discovery, owing to the multiplicity of passages, now increased
      momentarily. Any of these ghostly corridors might afford concealment to an
      enemy who, warned of danger by the muffled echo of approaching steps,
      might steal away, silently and unobserved, and so raise the alarm. Though
      still in his stocking feet, Don instinctively found himself treading on
      tip-toe, while the bare-footed blacks&mdash;who were even less inclined
      for a brush with the enemy than he&mdash;purposely did the same. Even then
      their movements, well-nigh noiseless though they were, caused commotion
      amongst the bats that clung in patches of living fungi to the vaulted
      roof, and sent them wheeling hither and thither in swift, startled flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      To succeed in finding his chum, and to liberate him ere discovery came,
      was almost more than Don dared hope for. For come it must, sooner or
      later. Only, once Jack was by his side, he cared little how soon or in
      what manner it came. True, the natives possessed the seeming advantage of
      overwhelming numbers; but in these rock corridors the nozzle of a single
      musket was better than a hundred men.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do him justice, he had thrust the pearls entirely out of his thoughts
      in his eagerness to set Jack at liberty. &ldquo;Time enough to think about the
      pearls afterwards,&rdquo; he said to himself&mdash;forgetting that &ldquo;afterwards&rdquo;
       was at the best but a blind alley, full of unknown pitfalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now well into the heart of the Elephant Bock, where any moment
      might bring them face to face with Jack or his captors, or both.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point the monkey, who was some yards in advance, suddenly stopped
      and uttered a peculiar hissing sound. Once before&mdash;when, on the rock
      platform, Bosin had given warning of the approach of the canoes&mdash;had
      Don heard that hiss. There was no mistaking its significance. He motioned
      to the blacks to halt, and with stealthy tread crept forward alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just ahead a sharp bend in the passage limited his view to a few yards of
      indifferently lighted wall. Hugging the inner side of this bend, he
      presently gained the jutting shoulder of rock which formed the dividing
      line between the vista of gallery behind and that ahead, and from this
      point of vantage peered cautiously round the projection in search of the
      cause of Bosin's alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was not far to seek. Immediately beyond the bend the passage expanded
      into a sort of vestibule, communicating, by means of a lofty portal, with
      a spacious, well-lighted chamber. It was not this discovery, however, that
      riveted his gaze, but a dusky figure crouched on the floor of the
      vestibule&mdash;the figure of a native, reclining on a mat, with his back
      to the spot where Don stood. By his side lay a sword of curious
      workmanship, and a huge conch-shell, the pearly pink of its inner surface
      contrasting strangely with the native's coffee-coloured skin. The weapon
      and the shell told their own tale: the native was doing &ldquo;sentry-go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Over what or whom? With swift glance Don scanned every nook and corner of
      the vestibule, and as much of the interior chamber as lay within range of
      his vision. So far as he could see both were empty, barring only the dusky
      sentinel. Then he fancied he heard the faint clanking of a chain, though
      from what direction the sound proceeded it was impossible to determine.
      Listening with bated breath, he heard it again, and now it seemed to come
      from the larger chamber. His pulses thrilled, and a determined light shone
      in his eyes as he turned them once more upon the sentinel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll jolly soon fix you, old chap,&rdquo; he said to himself; and noiselessly
      clubbing the musket he carried, he prepared to advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for the monkey's vigilance he must have come upon the recumbent guard
      without the slightest warning, for not more than ten paces separated the
      shoulder of rock&mdash;Don's post of observation&mdash;from the mat on
      which the native reclined.
    </p>
    <p>
      To fire upon him was out of the question, since that would fulfil the very
      purpose for which he, with his conch-shell trumpet, was stationed there&mdash;namely,
      to send a thousand wild echoes hurtling through chamber and galleries, and
      so apprise his comrades of impending danger. Moreover, Don had a wholesome
      horror of bloodshed, which at most times effectually held his trigger
      finger in check.
    </p>
    <p>
      A swift, sure blow&mdash;that would be the best means of keeping the
      native's lips from the nozzle of his conch-trumpet. A blow&mdash;ay, there
      was the-rub! For, though the native's back was towards-him, the space by
      which they two were divided must be crossed; and these walls, dumb as they
      looked, had hidden tongues, which would echo and re-echo the faintest
      sound. Could he, then, get near enough to strike?
    </p>
    <p>
      Inch by inch he crept towards the unconscious sentinel, slowly raising the
      butt of the musket as he advanced. So intense was the suspense of those
      few brief moments that he hardly breathed. It seemed as if the very
      beating of his heart must reach the native's ears. Inch by inch, foot by
      foot, until&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0011" id="linkimage-0011"> </a>
    </p>

      <a href="images/0213.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The native turned his head; but before he could spring to his feet, or
      even utter a cry, the musket crashed upon his shaven pate, and he rolled
      over on his side without a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don did not stop to ascertain the extent of his injuries. Neither did he
      summon the blacks. Again the clanking of chains rang in his ears, and at a
      bound he crossed the threshold of the larger chamber, An unkempt human
      figure started up in the far corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jack!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it really you, old fellow?&rdquo; cried Jack joyfully. &ldquo;Give us your
      hand; and how did you find your way here, I want to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have Bosin to thank for that,&rdquo; replied Don, returning his chum's'
      grip with interest. &ldquo;When I saw your handkerchief&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the monkey stole it, then! I missed it, don't you know, but never
      imagined that Bosin took it, though he paid me a visit early this morning.
      Well, he did me a good turn that time, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a better one when he led us back here. But,&rdquo; continued Don in
      hurried, suppressed tones, &ldquo;don't let us waste time palavering, Jack.
      There's not a moment to lose. I've done for old conchy yonder&mdash;knocked
      him on the head&mdash;but the rest may swoop down on us any minute. Say,
      how are you tethered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leg,&rdquo; said Jack laconically, rattling a chain which secured him to the
      wall. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;&mdash;as Don unslung his cutlass with the intention of
      hacking at the links&mdash;&ldquo;I'll show you a trick worth two of that. You
      see that ring-bolt the chain's fastened to? Well, it's set in lead&mdash;not
      very securely as it happens&mdash;and I've managed to work it so loose
      that I fancy a good hard tug ought to bring it away. Meant to make off on
      my own account, you see, if you hadn't turned up, old fellow. But lay hold
      and let's have a pull for it, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick, then!&rdquo; said Don. &ldquo;I thought I heard footsteps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Throwing their combined weight upon the chain, they pulled for dear life.
      The ring-bolt yielded little by little, and presently came away from its
      setting bodily, like an ancient tooth, and Jack was free. The chain, it is
      true, was still attached to his leg; but as it encircled only one ankle,
      this did not so much matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let it rattle,&rdquo; said Don breathlessly, &ldquo;I'm positive I heard
      footsteps. And here, take this,&rdquo; thrusting the cutlass into Jack's
      disengaged hand. &ldquo;Now, come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Barely had he uttered the words when a hollow, prolonged blast, like that
      of a gigantic trumpet with a cold in its throat, filled the chamber with
      deafening clamour. And as the echoes leapt from wall to wall, and buffeted
      each other into silence, another sound succeeded them, faint and far away,
      but swelling momentarily into ominous loudness and nearness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don clutched his companion's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fellow I knocked on the head&mdash;he's come to!&rdquo; he said thickly.
      &ldquo;That was the blast of his conch; and this&rdquo;&mdash;pausing with uplifted
      hand and bated breath until that other sound broke clearly on their ears&mdash;&ldquo;this
      is the tread of heaven only knows how many native feet. Jack, we're
      discovered!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVIII.&mdash;BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>our galleries
      centred on the rock-chamber, and the confused, tumultuous rush of feet
      which followed the blast of the conch-shell like an ominous echo,
      proceeded from that particular gallery opposite the vestibule.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to be a rare lot of them; but we needn't stop to reckon 'em up,&rdquo;
       said Jack, with a constrained laugh. &ldquo;Lead the way, old fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Into the smaller chamber they dashed, to find the exit blocked by the
      sentinel with sword drawn. Rapidly reversing his musket, Don bore down
      upon him&mdash;he, to do him justice, standing his ground bravely,&mdash;and
      with the butt-end of the weapon dealt the nigger a blow in the stomach
      that doubled him up like a broken bulrush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the others?&rdquo; cried Jack, as they rounded the shoulder of rock
      separating the antechamber from the passage. &ldquo;You never came alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I left them just here&mdash;told them to wait,&rdquo; said Don, peering
      about in search of the blacks. &ldquo;They must have gone back; thought they'd
      save their skins while they could, I suppose, the chicken-hearted beggars!
      Ha, here's Bosin, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Swinging the monkey upon his shoulder, he set off at a run down the
      passage, Jack following as close as the weight of the chain would allow
      him, to do. They had proceeded only a short distance when a faint,
      sepulchral shout brought them to a stand. The sound seemed to proceed from
      a gallery on their immediate right. The way out did not lie in that
      direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Pug's wheeze,&rdquo; said Don. &ldquo;They've taken the wrong turning;&rdquo; and he
      drew a deep breath to answer the call.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack interposed quickly. &ldquo;Stop! The natives will be down on us soon enough
      without, that. Off with you, old fellow, and fetch' pur party back. I'll
      wait here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Already Don was racing down the side passage. Presently Jack heard him
      jitter a cautious &ldquo;hullo.&rdquo; A short silence followed then the echoes told
      him that the fugitives were hastily retracing their steps. At the same
      moment a confused uproar burst on his ears from the direction of the
      chamber in his rear. The pursuing mob had turned the angle of the passage
      and were actually in sight. The chain attached to Jack's leg clanked
      impatiently. He fairly danced with excitement. That ill-advised move on
      the part of the blacks had almost proved fatal to their sole chance of
      escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not quite; for now Don and the blacks came up, Jack joined them, and,
      with the oncoming thunder of many feet loud in their ears, away they sped,
      running as they alone can run who know that death is at their heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two circumstances favoured them so long as the race was confined to the
      cramped limits of the corridors: the smallness of their own number, and
      the multitude of their pursuers. Where four could run with ease, forty
      wasted their breath in fighting each other for running room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must put the pit between us and-these howling demons while they're
      tumbling over each other in the passage here,&rdquo; cried Don.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was their only hope. Racing on by Jack's side, close on-the heels of
      the blacks, he rapidly explained to his chum&mdash;who knew nothing of the
      pit, having been brought into the rock by a more circuitous route&mdash;the
      nature of the contemplated manoeuvre; and gave Spottie and Puggles their
      instructions how to act, backed up by a wholesome threat of summary
      abandonment to the enemy should they shirk when it came to the crucial
      point, the plank. The blacks were to cross first, Jack next; while he,
      Don, would cover their retreat as best he could. To this arrangement Jack
      could raise no demur. He was too seriously handicapped by the chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A final spurt, and they cleared the tunnel and reached the pit. The plank
      lay where they had left it. Across it ran their only road to safety. At a
      significant signal from Don Spottie led off, and, when he had reached the
      further side in safety, Puggles followed in his tracks. Doffs threat,
      coupled with the ominous uproar belched forth by the mouth of the tunnel,
      eclipsed all fear of the crocodiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Jack,&rdquo; cried Don, ere the plank had ceased to vibrate under
      Puggles's tread, &ldquo;after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack crossed, and Don was in the act of stepping on the unstable bridge,
      when the foremost of the native gang burst from the gallery. One swift
      backward glance&mdash;a glance that stowed him how alarmingly narrow was
      the margin between escape and capture&mdash;and with outstretched arms he
      balanced himself on the handbreadth of plank&mdash;it was scarcely more&mdash;and
      began the perilous passage. Swift as was this backward glance, it sufficed
      to show him, too, that the leader of the pursuit was none other than the
      escaped lascar; and ere he had traversed half the plank's length, he felt
      it yield and rebound beneath the quick tread of the fellows feet. At the
      same instant Jack raised a warning shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are moments when the strongest nerve quails, the steadiest head
      swings a little off its balance, the surest foot slips. Such a moment did
      this prove for Don. The disconcerting vibration of the plank, the
      knowledge that the lascar was at his very back, Jack's sudden shout&mdash;these
      for an instant conspired against and overcame his natural cool-headedness.
      He made a hurried step or two, staggered, and, his foot catching in the
      rope where it encircled the plank a short distance from the end, he
      stumbled and fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fell! but in falling dislodged the end of the plank which lay behind him,
      and on which the lascar stood, from its hold upon the further brink of the
      pit. The lascar, throwing up his arms with a despairing shriek, plunged
      headlong into the pool, where he was instantly seized upon by the ravenous
      crocodiles and torn limb from limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0012" id="linkimage-0012"> </a>

      <a href="images/0223.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      And now, if ever, did the &ldquo;Providence that sits up aloft&rdquo; watch over Don.
      Almost miraculously, as it seemed, instead of plunging into the horrible
      death-trap below, he fell astride the plank, the hither end of which still
      retained its hold upon the rock at an angle of perhaps sixty-five degrees;
      and up this steep incline&mdash;whither Bosin had already preceded him&mdash;with
      Jack's assistance he managed to scramble. Then they laid hold upon the
      plank and dragged it from the pit, amid the furious howling of the baffled
      rabble debouching from the tunnel opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Safe over, at any rate,&rdquo; panted Don. &ldquo;But&mdash;good heavens! what's
      become of the lascar?&rdquo; For, suspended as he had been between life and
      death, he had neither heard the lascar's shriek nor witnessed the horrible
      manner in which he had received his quietus at the jaws of the crocodiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack pointed out a bright crimson blotch on the surface of the pool.
      &ldquo;We've seen the last of him, poor devil,&rdquo; said he with a shudder. &ldquo;Say,
      did I tell you&mdash;no, of course I didn't&mdash;that this fellows not <i>my</i>
      lascar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, not the lascar who's been hounding us all this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lascar who's been hounding us on the island here&mdash;yes; but not
      the one who tried to brain me on board the cutter and got the knife for
      his pains. <i>That</i> chap kicked the bucket shortly after he got ashore;
      this fellow's his brother. They're as like as two peas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don vented his astonishment in a shrill whistle. &ldquo;Then that accounts for
      it,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;for there being no scar on his shoulder, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely; and it came jolly near accounting for yours truly as well,&rdquo;
       said Jack, with a queer little laugh and a significant shrug of the
      shoulders. &ldquo;This fellow, you see&mdash;the one who was just now eaten by
      the crocodiles&mdash;raised a sort of vendetta against us when his brother
      died, and of course he wanted to try his hand on me first, since it was I
      who gave his brother his death-blow. He'd have done it, too, if it hadn't
      been for old Salambo. But the old man put his foot down&mdash;I overheard
      their talk last night, and that's how I know&mdash;and said he wouldn't
      allow any violence, lucky for me. He was hoping for overtures from you, I
      suppose. But I say, what's this about the scar? How do <i>you</i> know
      there was none on the fellow's shoulder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know? Why, you see, it was this way. I was swimming the creek
      yesterday morning&mdash;you shall hear how that came about later on, by
      the way&mdash;when the lascar,&rdquo; indicating the crimson blotch on the pool,
      &ldquo;tried to throttle me. I had to knock him on the head to quiet him. Then I
      towed him ashore, and the captain and I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The captain!&rdquo; cried Jack with a start. &ldquo;By Jove, we've left him behind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wild hurry-scurry and excitement of the last half-hour had afforded
      Don scant opportunity for speaking of the captain's sad end&mdash;had,
      indeed, driven all thought of the old sailor from his mind, as it also had
      from Jack's. Now that the captain was mentioned, however, Jack, naturally
      enough, jumped to the conclusion that he had formed one of the rescue
      party, and had been overlooked in their recent precipitate flight. The
      time was now come when he must be undeceived; but when Don attempted to
      disclose the sad truth emotion choked his utterance, and he could not. But
      Jack, gazing into his convulsed face, instinctively read there what his
      lips refused to utter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did it happen?&rdquo; he asked in a hushed, awed whisper. &ldquo;And how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Controlling his voice with an effort, &ldquo;Only last night,&rdquo; faltered Don;
      &ldquo;the lascar did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack turned away and buried his face in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was strangled,&rdquo; Don presently resumed, &ldquo;strangled with that cord you
      see tied to the rope there. Afterwards, when the lascar gave me the slip,
      as he did in the night, he took the cord with him; but Bosin somehow
      recovered it and fetched it back. I little guessed how it would serve the
      lascar out when I used it to bridge the pit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Retribution!&rdquo; cried Jack, flinging his hands impulsively away from his
      face. &ldquo;He's rightly served, the villain. Only&rdquo;&mdash;regretfully&mdash;&ldquo;I
      wish it had been me instead of the cord, that's all. But it's done,
      anyhow, so let's get out of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it was time; for during this conversation the natives had not been
      idle. At this very moment, indeed, a number of them rushed shouting from
      the tunnel, bearing other planks with which to bridge the chasm. Don and
      his chum did not wait to see this done. Without further loss of time they
      set out for the creek, in which direction the blacks had already preceded
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had they entered the tunnel, however, when they encountered the
      blacks, running back full pelt; and before Don could inquire the cause of
      their precipitate return, a shout, reverberating up the vaulted corridor
      from the semi-darkness ahead, made inquiry unnecessary. While he and Jack
      had dallied in fancied security, the natives, skirting the pit by another
      route, had cut off their retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, as if to increase the consternation caused by this discovery, at the
      same instant a chorus of yells in their rear announced that the party in
      pursuit had succeeded in bridging the pit anew.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX.&mdash;ONE-TO-TWENTY GIVES TWENTY-TO-ONE THE WORST OF IT.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>emmed in!&rdquo; cried
      Don, as the desperate character of the situation flashed upon him. &ldquo;Shall
      we try to cut our way through the gang ahead, or fall back on the pit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back!&rdquo; was Jack's prompt rejoinder. &ldquo;Once prevent the niggers in our rear
      from crossing the pit, and we're all right. We'll have more fighting room
      there, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Back they ran, hustling the blacks before them. At the pit matters were
      even worse than they had feared. Half-a-dozen planks already spanned the
      chasm, each of them black with natives, who jostled each other in their
      eagerness to cross, supremely indifferent to the reptilian horrors that
      awaited them should they lose their balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted Jack, pouncing upon the 'bobbing end of the nearest
      plank. &ldquo;Tumble 'em in! To the crocodiles with the beggars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though the occupants of the plank could understand not a syllable of
      Jack's speech, they readily understood his intention; and crowding back
      upon each other with warning cries, by their combined weight they hastened
      the very catastrophe they desired to avert. The plank bent like a bow,
      snapped in twain, and launched its shrieking burden into the abyss. In
      their frantic efforts to escape, a number of the doomed wretches clutched
      at a second plank that happened to lie within reach. Already heavily
      overloaded, this also gave way, and added its quota to the horrible
      commotion of the pool. Two planks were thus accounted for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Don and the blacks had not been slow to second Jack's efforts.
      By their united strength a third plank was dislodged, and they were in the
      act of attacking the fourth when their energies were diverted into another
      channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      For at this juncture the detachment of natives who had cut off the retreat
      to the creek suddenly appeared upon the scene. The remaining planks, too,
      now began to pour the enemy upon the hither side of the pit in steady
      streams.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rocky shelf' that here flanked the chasm had, perhaps, a width of
      three yards, and that portion of it to the left of the creek-tunnel's
      mouth, where the unmolested planks lay, was speedily packed with natives,
      armed with formidable pikes and knives, who bore down upon the little
      group with furious outcries and all the weight of superior numbers. Jack
      was the first to perceive the danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the right! It's all up with us if we're surrounded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suiting the action to the words, he darted to the right, closely followed
      by Don and the blacks. Here they stationed themselves side by side, the
      timid blacks in the rear, and prepared to meet their assailants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't be better!&rdquo; was Jack's cheerful comment, as he took a hasty
      survey of their surroundings. &ldquo;Wall on our right; pit on left; enemy in
      front; and elbow-room behind. Say, we'll buckle to with the muskets first,
      and reserve the cutlasses till it comes to close quarters. Look out;
      they're coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On came the howling, disorderly mob, maddened by the terrible fate of
      their comrades, and thirsting for vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Together the muskets rose to the level.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't fire too high. Now, let 'em have it hot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The walls of the narrow enclosure rocked with the thunderous report. The
      mob quailed, fell back: &ldquo;they had no stomach for cold lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; said Jack coolly as they rapidly reloaded; &ldquo;but I wish
      we had breechloaders! A ball, quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The human wave in front, silent except for a sullen murmur that only
      waited for the rush to be renewed ere it swelled into fury, was again
      raising its ugly, threatening crest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt if we check it this time,&rdquo; said Don, watching it with anxious
      eyes; &ldquo;they've seen us reload, and know where they have the advantage.
      Better get your cutlass&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready!&rdquo; cried his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wave, broke. A hoarse roar, a tumultuous rusk such as it seemed no
      human power could withstand, and it was upon them. Again the walls leapt
      to the thunder of the muskets; again the serried ranks quailed. But before
      the smoke had left the muzzles of the muskets, the wave swept on again
      with redoubled fury, poured itself upon and around the brave lads, swept
      them off their feet For a moment it seemed as if the death-balance must
      kick the beam.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the &ldquo;final tussle&rdquo; was not to be just yet. Spottie and Puggles,
      terrified into momentary daring by the imminence of their own danger, now
      threw themselves into the fray with an energy-which, if it did little
      execution, at least served to divert many a blow from their masters. No
      mean help that&mdash;to take the blows meant for another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor were the masters themselves slow to recognise and profit by this fact.
      Right and left they slashed, dealing terrific swinging blows when, they
      could get them in, lunging desperately at the sinewy, half-naked forms
      about them when they could not, until British pluck and British muscle
      told, as they ever must in a righteous struggle for life and liberty, and
      One-to-twenty found itself clear of the <i>mêlée</i>, with a ghastly ridge
      of wounded at its feet, and fighting room behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well they had it! For the space of one deep breath the disconcerted rabble
      suspended hostilities, as if unable to believe that Twenty-to-one had got
      the worst of it. Then their ranks closed up into a solid mass of dusky,
      perspiring, blood-stained forms, and the onslaught was renewed&mdash;not
      hurriedly now, but with a watchful determination, a guarded, fierceness,
      that forced One-to-twenty back foot by foot until but little room was left
      for fighting, and none, in sooth, for quarter when it should come, as soon
      it must, to the sheer wall and the bitter end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more the blacks had slunk to the rear&mdash;had, in fact, already
      reached the wall, where, since they could get no farther, they cowered in
      miserable anticipation of speedy death. The &ldquo;final tussle&rdquo; was not far off
      now. Don and Jack had barely room to swing their cutlasses in. So much of
      the rocky ledge as might be measured by a single backward stride&mdash;only
      that separated them from the wall and the last scene of all. Inch by inch,
      their teeth hard set, their breath coming and going in quick, laboured
      gasps, they contested this narrow selvage of life. So the balance hung,
      when there came a second momentary lull in the deadly game of give and
      take. The dusky foe could now afford to breathe, being confident of the
      issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keeping a wary eye upon their movements, Don seized his chum by the hand.
      &ldquo;I never thought it would come to&mdash;to this, old fellow,&rdquo; he said
      huskily; &ldquo;God knows I didn't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack swallowed hard several times before he could trust himself to reply.
      &ldquo;No more did I. But were not going to funk now, old fellow; and&mdash;and
      I'm glad it's to be together, anyhow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One mute, agonised look into each other's eyes; one last pressure of the
      hand, and again, shoulder to shoulder, they faced the foe and the
      inevitable end.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant, when it seemed that not a ghost of a chance remained,
      there arose on their immediate right a shrill chattering sound&mdash;a
      sound that, somehow, had in it a ring of joyousness so strangely out of
      keeping with the situation that Don turned with a start and a sudden
      thrill of hope towards the quarter whence it came. As he did so, his eyes
      fell upon Bosin, forgotten in the heat of the fray, and now perched&mdash;good
      God! upon what?
    </p>
    <p>
      Don clutched his companion's arm and pointed with unsteady finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX.&mdash;THE LAST STRAW.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> glance&mdash;more
      he did not dare bestow whilst confronted by that treacherous throng&mdash;showed
      Jack what he and Don had hitherto entirely failed (and no wonder!) to
      observe. In the extreme corner of the ledge on which they stood, a deep,
      narrow gash divided the towering side wall, and up this, clear to the
      summit of the rock, there ran a flight of steps. On these Bosin had
      perched himself. At their foot crouched the blacks, blind to everything
      except their own danger. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wake those niggers up, and start them on ahead up the steps!&rdquo; said Jack
      quickly. &ldquo;Look sharp! they're going to rush us again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Falling on Spottie and Puggles, by dint of vigorous cuffing and shoving
      Don succeeded in getting them on the stairs. Rapidly as this was done, it
      produced an instantaneous effect upon the native rabble. They too had
      overlooked the existence of the stairway until Don's action recalled it to
      mind. A moment later the opening was besieged by a clamouring, infuriated
      throng.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up with you, old fellow!&rdquo; cried Jack, turning on the natives with drawn
      cutlass after he had ascended some half-dozen steps, and thus covering his
      friend's retreat. &ldquo;You had your innings at the pit; now it's my turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stationed on the steps as he was, Jack would have possessed no mean
      advantage over the natives but for one circumstance. The chain attached to
      his leg dangled down the steps, and the natives, discovering this,
      promptly seized it. In a twinkling Jack was dragged back into the midst of
      the furious rabble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don was half-way up the steps when the uproar caused by this mishap
      reached his ears. He turned just in time to see his companion disappear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the steps he bounded, clearing half-a-dozen at a leap, until barely
      that number lay between him and the bottom, where, owing to Jack's
      desperate resistance, the natives had their hands too full to notice his
      approach. Gauging the distance with his eye, he took a flying leap from
      this height into the very midst of them, scattering them in all
      directions. As he intended, he overleapt his friend, who now quickly
      regained his feet. Before the natives had time to recover from the shock
      of Don's precipitate arrival in their midst, he and Jack were well up the
      steps again. One or two of the gang made as if to follow them, but turned
      tail when menaced with the cutlasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nick and go that time!&rdquo; cried Don, as he gained the top and threw himself
      exhausted upon the rock. &ldquo;Just for a minute I thought it was all U.P.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; said Jack, with more gravity than grammar; &ldquo;and, between
      ourselves, the sensation wasn't half pleasant, either. But, I say, are you
      hurt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; nothing worse than a scratch or two. And you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm all right. Though it's little short of a miracle that we weren't
      spitted on those beastly pikes. Say, do you think they'll try to rush us
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly, after the lesson we've taught them; unless, indeed, there is a
      wider approach to the summit here than those steps. We ought to look about
      us at once so as to make sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; assented Jack. &ldquo;Let's load the muskets and leave the
      niggers in charge here while we take our bearin's like, as the captain
      used to say, poor old chap!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when it came to charging the muskets&mdash;old-fashioned
      muzzle-loaders, it will be remembered&mdash;they made an unpleasant
      discovery. Don had lost his powder-flask in the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make matters worse, Spottie, when called upon to produce his, confessed
      that he had left it on board the cutter in the hurry of the start. Only
      Pug's flask remained; but this, unfortunately, was nearly empty. There was
      barely enough powder left for three charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was but one of a series of disconcerting revelations which quickly
      followed the loading of the muskets.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, the most careful search failed to disclose any other
      means of egress from the Rock. In all the length and breadth of its summit
      they could find no opening except the one by which they had ascended,
      while on every hand its sides fell away in declivities so steep and smooth
      that not even Bosin could have found a foothold upon them&mdash;-or in
      perpendicular precipices that made the head swim as one looked down from
      their dizzy height upon the town, or sands, or jungle, far below.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the bright sky above, and the free air of heaven all around them,
      they were as effectually hemmed in as when that bristling array of pikes
      forced them back to the blank wall. The jaws of the trap were a little
      wider; the effects of its deadly grip a little delayed&mdash;that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      To add to the horrors of their position, absolute starvation stared them
      in the face in the event of a prolonged siege. Since early morning they
      had eaten nothing, and the day was now far advanced; they had brought no
      food with them, and none was procurable here. A small temple crowned the
      Rock; but when they penetrated it in the hope of finding fruit or other
      edible offerings, its dustladen shrine spoke only too plainly of long
      disuse. Even the thin clusters of dates upon the few palms that eked out a
      stunted existence in a shallow depression of the Rock were acrid,
      shrivelled, and wholly unfit for food. The pit, it is true, contained
      water; but this, even had it been drinkable, lay hopelessly beyond their
      reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No powder, no grub, no drink; it's a pretty, pickle to be in, anyhow,&rdquo;
       said Jack, ruefully summing up these calamitous discoveries as they
      rejoined the blacks at the head of the stairs. &ldquo;And, by Jove!&rdquo; pointing
      down the steps, &ldquo;they've gone and doubled the guard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The waters the worst,&rdquo; he presently resumed, scanning the arid expanse of
      rock thirstily. &ldquo;We could hold out for days, if we only had a supply of
      that. As it is, I don't dare think what this place will be like under a
      midday sun&mdash;ugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the more reason we should leave it, then,&rdquo; said Don.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don was silent. The question did not seem to admit of an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, see here, old' fellow,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;I admit, of course, that U.P. is
      written large all over the face of things just now; but at the same time
      it strikes me there's more than one way of getting off our white
      elephant's back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's only the tunnel to the creek,&rdquo; said Don, &ldquo;and that's not going to
      help us much while it's chock-full of natives, and we have no powder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why not go over the cliff?&rdquo; demanded Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      This daring and seemingly absurd proposal Don greeted with a stare of
      utter incredulity. &ldquo;That would be facing death with a vengeance,&rdquo; was his
      far from encouraging comment. &ldquo;How high do you estimate the cliff to be,
      anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A couple of hundred feet or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don laughed. &ldquo;You may as well say thousands, so far as our chances of
      reaching the base in safety are concerned.. The thing's a sheer
      impossibility, I tell you; Bosin himself couldn't do it. You're downright
      mad to think of it, Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I? I admit the difficulty, but not the impossibility. What Bosin can't
      do, we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, I should like to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By making a rope. See here, did you notice those palm-trees we passed
      while making the round of the Rock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did; but 'pon my word I don't see what they've got to do with your
      proposal. Ropes don't grow on palm-trees.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but they do, though. Do you mean to say that you never saw the
      natives make a rope out of the branches of a palm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I have. And what's more, I know how it's done. But say,&rdquo; his
      tone suddenly changing to one of anxiety, &ldquo;suppose the palm-leaves don't
      give, us enough material?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not sure they will,&rdquo; said Jack doubtfully, &ldquo;unless we spin it, out
      pretty fine; and that, of course, increases the danger of breakage. Well,
      if we run short, we can make shift with the blacks' clothes and turbans.
      But it's going to take a jolly long time to make&mdash;though we ought to
      finish it easily by to-morrow night. Then, ho for the cliff! And now, old
      fellow, just lie down, will you, and take a snooze: you're completely done
      up. When the moon rises I'll call you, and we'll have a whack at the
      trees, while Pug and Spottie do sentry-go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The blacks, poor fellows, were already sound asleep, with Bosin snuggled
      up between them; and Don was not long in following them into that realm of
      dreams, where waking cares, if they intrude at all, more often than not
      lie low and shadowy on the horizon. So Jack was left alone in the darkness
      and solitude of the Rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kicking off his shoes, and tucking the end of the chain beneath his belt
      to secure perfect noiselessness of movement, he shouldered a musket, and
      fell to pacing back and forth past the black orifice that marked the point
      where the stairway cleft the rocky floor. Monotonous work it was, and
      weird. The steely glint of the stars, the mournful sobbing of the surf
      upon the sands, sent an involuntary shiver through his frame. He crept
      softly to the extreme brink of the chasm and peered into its depths. Below
      all was pitchy blackness; he could distinguish nothing, save, far down, at
      an infinite depth as it seemed, the faint, fantastic reflection of a star
      on the surface of the pool. Occasionally a sound of lazy splashing floated
      up to where he stood, and he thought with creeping flesh of the horrible,
      ghoulish surfeit the crocodiles had had that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      To and fro beneath the steely stars&mdash;tramp, tramp, tramp, to the
      solemn dirge of the sea. Would the laggard moon never rise and put an end
      to his weird vigil?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hark! what was that? He paused and listened with suspended breath, his
      back towards the dim outline of the stairway; listened, but heard only the
      moaning of the surf and the regular, sonorous breathing of his sleeping
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of those gorged crocodile beasts got a nightmare,&rdquo; he muttered, with
      a smile at the comic aspect of his own fancy. &ldquo;Ha,&rdquo; catching sight of a
      faint, silvery glow in the east, &ldquo;there's the moon at last. Time to call
      our fellows; I've had enough of this death's watch, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While uttering these words he made a step forward with the intention of
      calling Don and the blacks, when something whizzed swiftly through the
      air, he felt a sharp twinge, an intense burning sensation in his left arm,
      a deathly faintness stealing over him, and realised that he was wounded&mdash;wounded
      by a dexterously-thrown knife, which, had it not been for that timely
      forward stride, must have buried itself deep in his back. Luckily, in
      spite of the pain and giddiness, he retained his presence of mind. Quick
      as a flash he, wheeled, brought the hammer of the musket to full cock, and
      the musket itself to his shoulder. Above the yawning staircase the outline
      of a human figure showed indistinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One for you,&rdquo; muttered Jack, and fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The figure threw up its arms and fell backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The report of the musket brought Don to his feet. &ldquo;What's the row?&rdquo; he
      asked, running to his companion's side in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of other figures in lieu of the first supplied a more
      pertinent answer to this question than Jack could have given. He snatched
      up one of the remaining muskets, Jack possessing himself of the other. By
      this time Spottie and Puggles were also up, but, like the dutiful servants
      they were, they kept well in the rear of their masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enemy were now literally swarming up the steps and sides of the
      stairway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack gave the word&mdash;&ldquo;Blaze away!&rdquo; and a double report went hurtling
      wildly out over the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clubbing their muskets, they then fell upon and began clubbing the
      escaladers with an energy that speedily choked the contracted avenue of
      approach to the summit of the Rock with a heaving, scrambling, trampling
      mass of natives, whose desperate struggles to regain their lost foothold
      upon the steps only served to facilitate their descent to the bottom. In
      five minutes' time the repulse was complete; the foe retreated into the
      dark security of the chasm, leaving some six or eight of their number
      lying upon the scene of the affray. Jack threw aside his musket and
      sprang: down the steps to where they lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you after now?&rdquo; cried Don, leaping down after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cloths,&rdquo; was Jack's laconic rejoinder, as he unceremoniously began to
      divest the natives of the long strips of country cotton that encircled
      their waists. &ldquo;We want these for our rope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On hearing this Don also set to work, and in a short time they had secured
      some half-dozen cloths, together with an equal number of turbans, which
      lay scattered all up and down the steps like enormous mushrooms. With this
      booty they returned in triumph to the summit of the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll average twelve feet at least,&rdquo; said Jack, eyeing the tumbled heap
      critically. &ldquo;Let's see&mdash;twelve twelves make a hundred and forty-four;
      and by tearing them in two down the middle we'll get double length. Total,
      two hundred and eighty-eight feet. Hurrah, we've got our rope!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a far safer one,&rdquo; observed Don, &ldquo;than if we had patched it up out of
      those palm-leaves. Well, it's an ill wind that&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got no further, for Jack suddenly dropped at his feet as though he had
      been shot. He had fainted from loss of blood, as Don, to his horror,
      quickly discovered. As a matter of fact, the knife that had penetrated
      Jack's arm was still in the wound, and its projecting hilt was the first
      intimation Don received of his chum's hairbreadth escape. By the time he
      had removed the knife, ripped open the coat-sleeve, and bandaged the wound
      with a fragment torn from one of the cloths, Jack opened his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you tell me about this?&rdquo; exclaimed Don reproachfully. &ldquo;How did
      it happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? Oh, one of those treacherous niggers shot his knife at me&mdash;the
      old trick,&rdquo; said Jack, scrambling to his feet and shaking himself with
      nonchalant air, &ldquo;I'd have told you, only I forgot it in the scuffle,
      Nothing but a scratch, anyway; I'm all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don's look was rather dubious, for, in spite of his companion's assumption
      of <i>sang-froid</i>, he could not but foresee the possible effect of a
      badly-wounded arm upon their proposed descent of the cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was now well above the horizon; so, setting the blacks to watch
      the stairs, they went to work on the rope at once&mdash;an easy task
      compared to what it must have been had they attempted to utilise the
      tough, fibrous palm-branches, as at first proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't told me yet,&rdquo; Jack presently observed, pausing in his task of
      knotting together the long strips of cloth as Don tore them off ready to
      his hand; &ldquo;you haven't told me how you came to lay the lascar by the heels&mdash;in
      the creek, I think you said? Let's have the story now, old fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there's a whole cable's-length of events leading up to that,&rdquo; said
      Don. &ldquo;I'd better begin at the beginning&mdash;with your disappearance, I
      mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So there, beneath the stars, while the rope which was to ensure escape
      from the Rock grew under, their busy fingers, he recounted link by link
      the chain of events which the days and nights of Jack's absence had
      forged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far into the night did the story spin itself out, for Jack had many
      questions to ask, many comments to make; until at last it came to that
      terrible moment when Don had sought to rouse the captain, and found him to
      be sleeping the sleep that knows no waking. His voice grew choked and
      husky then Jack bent low over his work, and tears glistened in the ghostly
      moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in his jacket pocket I found this,&rdquo; concluded Don, producing the
      well-thumbed Prayer Book. &ldquo;On the fly-leaf&mdash;no, you can't make it out
      now, the light is so faint&mdash;but on the fly-leaf the dear old chap had
      written that whatever happened, he was to be buried at sea. So this
      morning, just before daybreak, we put off in the cutter, and gave him what
      he wished for&mdash;a seaman's burial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack knew the whole sad story now, and for a time they fell into one of
      those silences which, somehow, are apt to follow the mention of the dead
      who have endeared themselves to us in life&mdash;silences eloquent, in
      their very stillness, of regret and grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, it's done,&rdquo; said Jack at last, as he tied and tested the final
      knot. &ldquo;And now, hurrah for the cliff!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Don had begun to coil the rope, when he suddenly paused in his task and
      exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, how are we going <i>to fasten the end?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fasten the end? Why, to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Jack came to an abrupt stop,
      adding blankly after a moment: &ldquo;Blest if I know what we <i>can</i> fasten
      it to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; Don acknowledged, as much taken aback as his companion by the
      appalling nature of this discovery. &ldquo;There are the palms, of course, and
      the temple; but they're too far from the cliff to be of any use. The rope
      will hardly reach as it is, I'm afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there must be some way of securing it,&rdquo; replied Jack incredulously,
      &ldquo;Surely there's a crack or something we can wedge one of the cutlasses
      into. Let's look, anyhow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Look they did, but not with the result Jack had so confidently
      anticipated. From side to side, from end to end of the Rock, they searched
      and searched again, even going down on their hands and knees that they
      might perchance feel what had escaped the eye, But without avail. So far
      as the moonlight enabled them to discern&mdash;and it made the place
      nearly as light as day&mdash;neither crack nor projection marred the
      smooth surface of the stone. They gave it up at length, utterly
      disheartened. Even Jack felt this to be the last straw, and abandoned
      himself to despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a bad job altogether,&rdquo; was the despondent comment with which he
      threw himself down beside the apparently useless coil of rope. &ldquo;God help
      us, we haven't a ghost of a chance left!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, things aren't quite so bad as that!&rdquo; replied his companion, with an
      assumption of hopefulness he was far from feeling. &ldquo;Who can say what may
      turn up? The darkest hour is just before the dawn, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;suppose there isn't any dawn, what then?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI. RIVALS FOR THE HONOURS OF DEATH.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> night of dread
      foreboding, of weary watching for the day that seemed as if it would never
      come. With what tantalising slowness did the snail-like stars crawl across
      the black vault of the heavens! And when day came, what then?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hunger and thirst, danger and despair, and the certainty of death! But no
      need to await the dawn for these; already they were here. Comfortable
      bed-fellows, truly, and for a bed the bare, unyielding rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack lay with his head pillowed upon the coil of rope. Not that he found
      it a comfortable resting-place. The knowledge of what the rope could <i>not</i>
      do for them made it a pillow of thorns. He could not rest. The last thread
      of hope had broken, plunging him into the abyss of despair. Besides, his
      arm had become extremely painful within the last hour; he was restless,
      feverish. Fever goads the brain. Jack's brain was just then busier,
      perhaps, than it had ever been before. He felt none of the sharp gnawings
      of hunger, none of the insatiable cravings of thirst, though, as a matter
      of fact, these were even then conspiring with his wound to fever his blood
      and keep him awake, and make him think, think, think with: never an
      instant's pause. When thought is goaded like this, it speedily verges on
      delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      To give way to despondency was not at all like Jack; and as he tossed from
      side to side and thought upon the &ldquo;whine&rdquo; (that was what he called it, in
      his own mind) in which he had indulged a little while ago when the utter
      desperateness of the situation first burst upon him&mdash;when he thought
      of this, he felt heartily ashamed of himself. He was a coward, a rank,
      out-and-out coward. He hated himself for his faint-hearted, babyish lack
      of spirit. But he would redeem his reputation yet. He would show them&mdash;meaning
      Don and the blacks&mdash;that he was no coward, anyhow!
    </p>
    <p>
      The blacks, as they crossed and recrossed each other on their noiseless
      beat, thought little and said less. They were desperately hungry, and
      hunger is the one fellow-feeling that does not make us wondrous kind.
      Every now and then they tightened their waist-cloths a little, but beyond
      this gave no outward sign or token of what they thought or felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the night wore on, and still Jack thought in restless silence. There
      was a deeper flush on his cheek, but it was no longer the flush of shame.
      The fever in his blood, the delirium in his brain, were rising. So was his
      resolution. He flung himself about restlessly, muttering. He would show
      them he was no coward, anyhow!
    </p>
    <p>
      So the night wore on, until by-and-by, as Don turned for the hundredth
      time upon his uneasy couch&mdash;for he, too, was unable to rest&mdash;his
      hand came into accidental contact with that of his chum. He started;
      Jack's hand was fiery hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Housed by his companion's touch and movement, Jack sat bolt upright, and
      gazed about him in an excited, feverish fashion, muttering incoherently.
      His breath came and went in short, hurried catches, and in his eyes shone
      an unnatural wildness that struck terror to Don's heart. Knowing nothing
      of his chum's resolve, he thought him simply delirious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lie down,&rdquo; he said soothingly, placing his hand on Jack's shoulder, and
      attempting, with gentle force, to push him back into his former recumbent
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack flung the hand aside petulantly. Whatever of delirium there might be
      in his eyes and manner, his words, though spoken rapidly and with
      excitement, were rational enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, old fellow,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;it's all my fault, your being here in
      this fix; and I'm bound to do my level best to get you safe out of it,
      especially after the way I funked a while back. No, don't cut in and try
      to stop me&mdash;I know what I'm saying right enough, though I expect I do
      look a bit wild and that. Now, my arm here&mdash;I ain't said much about
      it&mdash;'tain't like me to whine, anyhow&mdash;at least not often&mdash;but
      all the same, my arm's getting jolly bad. Knotting the rope and that, you
      see, has made it a bit worse, and&mdash;well, the fact is, old fellow, I
      don't believe I could go down that rope to save my neck, even supposing it
      to be fastened, you understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feared as much,&rdquo; said Don gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes? Well, that's just how it stands,&rdquo; Jack went rapidly on. &ldquo;Tisn't that
      I'm afraid, you understand&mdash;there's no cliff hereabouts that would
      make me funk&mdash;it's simply that my arm's out of gear and won't work.
      Not even if the rope were fastened, you see, which it isn't. And that's
      what I'm coming at, old fellow. Look here, I'll tell you what we <i>can</i>
      do. Spottie and Pug can lower you away&mdash;over the cliff, you know&mdash;and
      then, when Pug and I have sent Spottie after you, I'll manage somehow to
      pay out the line while Pug follows. He's the lightest weight of the lot,
      anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All very well,&rdquo; demurred Don, who thought he saw a fatal objection to
      Jack's plan, &ldquo;but how will you get down yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my getting down isn't in the bill at all,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;I mean to stay
      right here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This announcement fairly took Don's breath away. He had supposed all along
      that Jack was holding the pith of his proposal in reserve; but never once
      had he so much as dreamed of such a climax as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! stop here?&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;You don't know what you're saying&mdash;it's
      certain death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope I ain't such a duffer as not to know that,&rdquo; said Jack brusquely.
      &ldquo;All the same, I mean to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't say that, Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Better one than four.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll stop with you,&rdquo; said Don, with dogged determination. &ldquo;The
      blacks may have my chance and welcome. Nothing on earth will induce me to
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His chum was silent for a long time after that&mdash;so long, indeed, that
      Don thought the matter settled for good and all. But in this he was
      mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, old fellow,&rdquo; said Jack at last, &ldquo;tell you what I'll do; I'll toss
      you as to which of us is togo. What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried Don.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why not? Where's the use of being such a softie over the matter?
      There are no end of reasons why I should stay, I tell you. For one thing,
      I've got no mother to consider.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true enough,&rdquo; assented Don, gulping as he thought of his own
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no sisters or brothers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't,&rdquo; said Don huskily; &ldquo;you forget me, Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't,&rdquo; protested Jack; &ldquo;you are more to me than any brother could
      ever be, old man; but that's only an additional reason why I should see
      you safe out of this mess. Then there's another thing; you know how good
      the guv has always been to me&mdash;sent me to school, and treated me just
      as if I was his own son, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Don.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've always felt that if ever I got the chance I should like to
      repay his kindness, don't you know; and now that the chance has come I
      don't mean to let it slip. Say, will you toss?&rdquo; Don wavered. It seemed
      terribly hard that they should all have to die like so many rats in a
      trap. Besides, once he and the blacks were off the Rock, they could fall
      back on the cutter, renew their stock of ammunition, and&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll toss you on one condition,&rdquo; he said suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What condition's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this. That after the die is cast we take no further steps until
      daylight, so as to make quite sure there's no way of securing the rope to
      the rock. Are you agreed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For reply Jack held out his hand, and thus the compact was sealed. Then
      Don drew a rupee from his pocket and passed it to his companion... &ldquo;Tails,
      you go,&rdquo; said Jack, and tossed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flash of silver in the moonlight, a mocking jingle, and the coin lay
      still. Eagerly the rivals for the honours of death bent over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tails!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; said Jack quietly; &ldquo;and what's more, I'm jolly glad it isn't
      heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His chum turned quickly away and bowed his head upon his knees, while a
      sound suspiciously like a stifled sob broke the stillness of the night.
      Jack crept close up to him and slipped an arm about his neck. So, for a
      long time, they sat in silence.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII.&mdash;A REPORT FROM THE SEA.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>ack was the first
      to break the silence that followed the spinning of the fateful coin. He
      rose, stretched himself, and, pointing to a ruddy glow that had begun to
      light up the eastern horizon, exclaimed in a voice of undisguised relief:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daybreak at last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wish it would never come,&rdquo; his companion rejoined gloomily,
      turning his gaze upon the unwelcome light&mdash;of which, however, he had
      caught scarce a glimpse ere he sprang to his feet in sudden excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's no daybreak, Jack! It's more like the reflection of a fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you're right,&rdquo; assented Jack. &ldquo;It certainly <i>is</i> a fire;
      but where can it be, that we see only the reflection? Behind Haunted
      Pagoda Hill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; this side of the hill, I should say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it must be somewhere in the creek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At mention of the creek Don started violently, a suspicion of the truth
      flashing upon him. He began to sniff the air. An odour of smoke floated to
      them on the fresh morning breeze, faint but pungent. Jack, catching a
      whiff of it, fell to sniffing too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you make of it?&rdquo; Don inquired anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tar!&rdquo; replied Jack, without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; said Don, with a queer catch in his voice. &ldquo;Jack, it's the
      cutter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this he set off at a run towards that part of the Rock which
      overlooked the creek. Advancing as far as the rapidly-increasing slope of
      the declivity, made it prudent to venture, he came to a stand. The glow of
      the fire was now brighter, though its source still remained hidden from
      view; but by edging his way well to the right, he at length succeeded in
      reaching a point whence the ruddy light that had excited his fears could
      be seen as a leaping, swaying column of smoke and flame, terminating, far
      down amid the darkness of the creek, in a single point of lurid red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as I feared!&rdquo; he cried, as Jack rejoined him. &ldquo;The niggers have set
      fire to the <i>Jolly Tar</i>. I was afraid the rascals had smelt her out
      when I met the lascar in the creek the other morning. The old boat's done
      for, anyhow; so let me off my promise, Jack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for? I can't see that the burning of the cutter has anything to do
      with it. There are plenty of native boats to get away in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it isn't the getting away! You don't suppose I'd go off and leave you
      in the lurch, I hope? It's the powder that troubles me. There wasn't much
      on board the cutter, it's true; just about enough to fight my way back
      here with&mdash;as I meant to do, please God, had this not happened. I
      planned the whole thing out while we sat mooning yonder, you see. But
      now!&rdquo; and at thought of how this hope&mdash;the secret of his acquiescence
      in the outcome of that fatal toss&mdash;had vanished into thin air before
      his very eyes, Don's lips trembled and his voice choked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, old chap!&rdquo; said Jack, deeply touched by this new proof of his
      friend's generosity; &ldquo;I'll take the will for the deed. But, I say&mdash;you
      pledged me your word, you know; and at daybreak, if no way of anchoring
      the rope shows up, I shall expect you to go over the cliff like a man. We
      shan't have long to wait now. Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed to a deep roseate hue which tinged the sky just above the ocean
      rim. And even as they stood watching it, the light came leaping up from
      the sea, and outshone the stars, and set the whole east aglow. A flush of
      dawn, and it was day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Jack, tightening his belt, &ldquo;let's make the round of the Rock
      again. If there's a shadow of a flaw anywhere we're bound to find it in
      this light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven grant we may!&rdquo; ejaculated Don, as they began the search.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cliff forming the Elephant's left side was out of it altogether. The
      native town lay directly at its base, rendering escape in that direction
      impracticable. So, too, with that part of the Rock abutting on the creek;
      its formation was such that no human being, rope or no rope, could have
      made his way down its face. There remained only the Elephant's right flank&mdash;overlooking
      the jungly back of the island&mdash;and the loftier head parts facing the
      western sea. To these, then, the search was necessarily confined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again and yet again did they pace the dizzy heights, scanning every inch
      of the rocky surface for that crack or projection upon the existence of
      which Jack's life was staked. But, as before, the search ended in failure
      and despair. There was absolutely nothing&mdash;neither crevice, nor
      jutting point, nor friendly block of stone&mdash;in which, or to which,
      the rope's end could be made fast: nothing but Jack's body!
    </p>
    <p>
      To secure the rope to the palms or the masonry of the temple was an utter
      impossibility. It was too short by half.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a last hope Don approached the chasm in which lay the pool. But the
      hope was short-lived. The native guard had been trebled overnight. Hope&mdash;so
      far, at least, as Jack's life was concerned&mdash;stood on a par with the
      powder: not a grain was left.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, Don had all along indulged a secret conviction that
      &ldquo;something would turn Up.&rdquo; Now, when the terrible truth was at last forced
      upon him in such a manner that he could no longer shut his eyes to it, his
      distress was pitiable to witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hazarded his friend's life on the toss of a coin&mdash;and lost!
      And now he must go over the cliff&mdash;over the cliff to safety and life&mdash;over
      the cliff by means of a rope, at the death-end of which stood his dearest
      friend. Given his choice, he would have taken that friend's place&mdash;oh,
      how gladly! But go he must, for his honour was-pledged, and the time was
      come!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ay, the time was come&mdash;the supreme moment of Jack's heroic resolve.
      And Jack was glad of it, ready for it. The fever in his blood had abated,
      leaving him cool, collected, and more firm in his resolve than ever. He
      had chosen his-course and he would stick to it, anyhow!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said simply, laying a gentle hand on Don's shoulder, &ldquo;it is
      time for us to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For us!&rdquo; The words, though kindly meant stabbed Don to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kicking the coil of rope before him like a ball, Jack approached the brink
      of the precipice. The blacks followed. There was little danger of their
      being missed by the native guard, unless the latter mounted the steps, and
      this they were not likely to do after the severe lesson they had received
      in the night. Last of all came Don&mdash;slowly, reluctantly. He looked
      and felt like one going to his execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word Jack picked up the loose end of the rope and knotted it
      securely about his friend's chest, beneath his arms. When he had uncoiled
      the rope to its full length, he fastened the other end about his own
      waist. Then he held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, old fellow,&rdquo; he said, his voice shaking in spite of himself.
      &ldquo;Good-bye, and God bless you! Be sure and cast the rope loose when you
      reach the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jack, Jack! Must I go&mdash;must I?&rdquo; cried Don desperately, his voice
      full of agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      With unfaltering step Jack led him to the extreme brink of the cliff, left
      him there with his face set towards liberty and life, turned back, and
      beckoning to the blacks&mdash;who had purposely been kept in ignorance of
      Jack's resolve&mdash;prepared to pay out the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over with you, old fellow! As gently as you can!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rope tightened. Wheeling where he stood, Don cast one last imploring
      look at his friend, who pointed upwards and then motioned him to go. He
      obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      As the remorseless Rock closed above him, he let himself swing, neither
      seeing nor caring whither he was being lowered. The abyss below had no
      terrors for him&mdash;he even hoped that the rope might snap&mdash;why
      should he live since Jack must die? And when at last his feet touched
      earth, and he had flung the rope from him like a hated thing, he threw
      himself upon his face at the foot of the insurmountable cliff and burst
      into a passion of bitter, remorseful tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time a gentle thud on the back aroused him. He looked up. It was
      the rope again, but empty! What did it mean? Where was Spottie? Why had he
      not been sent down? What had happened? A dozen questions such as these
      flashed through his brain, and with them a sudden wild hope. He started to
      his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A scrap of paper was secured to the rope by a half-knot. He snatched at
      it, drawing it to him with something of dread in the movement. It was a
      leaf from Jacks note-book, scrawled over with writing in Jack's familiar
      hand. His eyes devoured the words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good news! A wonderful thing has happened. Was just going to lower
      Spottie away when the report of a gun came booming up from the sea. The
      schooner&mdash;the governor's schooner&mdash;is at anchor off the front of
      the island! I'd signal her, only I have no powder. I'm all in a daze,
      anyhow; but you'll know what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An exclamation of intense gratitude to Heaven burst from Don's lips, and
      crushing the scrap of paper in his hand, he set off at a run along the
      base of the cliff, in the direction of the Elephant's head.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.&mdash;DON RUNS THE GAUNTLET.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here was but one
      thing to be done: he must gain the schooner with all possible speed, at
      any risk, and take immediate steps for Jack's rescue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively he shaped his course for the Elephant's head. The
      precipitous cliff was there skirted by a narrow beach. He had seen it
      gleaming above the surf-line while rounding the island on the morning of
      their arrival. This beach would afford a short-cut to the front of the
      island, off which the schooner lay. Once there, he must swim for it. These
      were his thoughts as he ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tough work it was. True, the jungle did not grow close up to the base of
      the cliff; but here and there yawning <i>nullahs</i>, of considerable
      depth, and with sides almost as-steep as walls, had been cut across his
      pathway by the rains. At intervals, too, he encountered rugged, irregular
      heaps of stones, fallen from the cliff above, and studded thick with
      thorny clumps of prickly-pear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cutlass at his side impeded his progress. He threw it away. Then on
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sands at last! Close on his right lay the sea, close on his left rose
      the beetling cliff. There was not much room&mdash;just enough to run in.
      Away before him, like a narrow ribbon of burnished silver, stretched the
      smooth, hard sands, with never a living thing in sight on all their
      gleaming reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually the cliffs crept behind, and the seafront opened out before him.
      And now, of a sudden, he espied a group of natives making for the beach&mdash;a
      company of fishermen, laden with creels, and oars, and nets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just ahead, a wedge-shaped gully split the low bank that bordered the
      beach on the landward side. Above this bank were the fishermen, heading
      for the gully. They were perhaps fifty yards short of it, while he, on the
      beach below the bank, was a full hundred. Should they reach it first, he
      would certainly be intercepted; whereas, could he but pass the point of
      danger ere' the natives gained it, he might succeed in eluding them. They
      did not see him yet. He darted under the bank, and ran as he had never run
      in all his life before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seventy-five yards, fifty yards, twenty yards&mdash;and then the gully.
      Had the natives reached it? As he raced past he darted a swift sidelong
      glance at the <i>nullah</i>. The fishermen were already halfway down it.
      They saw him, dropped their fishing implements, and gave chase, yelling
      like a pack of fiends.
    </p>
    <p>
      On and on he ran, looking back but once to ascertain what start he had of
      the dusky gang. Twenty yards at least. They were just emerging from the
      bottom of the gully.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, away to the right, he sighted the schooner, riding at anchor with
      half a mile of sea between her holding-ground and the shore. He could see
      her boats swinging at the davits. They had not sighted him, then. He
      wondered whether Jack could see him from the cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack caught sight of Don as he raced past the gully. The fishermen, as it
      happened, were just then in the gully itself, and consequently invisible.
      Don's appearance he hailed with a shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hurrah! he hasn't lost much time, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This exclamation brought both Spottie and Puggles to his side in hot
      haste. The stairs were thus left unguarded&mdash;a step the imprudence of
      which was wholly overlooked in the excitement of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sight of his master tearing along the beach below, a grim delight&mdash;not
      unmixed with anxiety&mdash;overspread Puggles' black countenance, while a
      chuckle of intense satisfaction welled up from the red abyss of his fat,
      shiny throat. Then, like the shadow of an April cloud driven swiftly
      across a sunlit meadow, a look of blank dismay eclipsed the grin, the
      chuckle died away in a gasp of alarm, and pointing to the beach with
      shaking finger, he cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sar! sar! black warmints done catch um, sar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His alarm was well-founded. The fishermen had just tumbled out of the
      gully, at Don's very heels, as it seemed at this distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're after him, sure enough,&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;By Jove, how he runs! Go
      it, old fellow! you've got the start of them, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Away went Don, running like a deer, and after him pelted the fishermen, in
      a headlong, rough-and-tumble, happy-go-lucky fashion, that, under
      circumstances less serious, must have provoked the spectators on the Rock
      to hearty laughter. No laughing matter this, however; for Don's pursuers,
      having thrown aside their fishing gear, and being moreover fresh in wind
      and limb, were seen to gain on him at every stride. The race could not
      prolong itself for many minutes now, and the finish&mdash;Jack shuddered,
      as he thought of what that must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this critical juncture, too, matters took an unexpected turn for the
      worse. A short distance up the beach a second party of natives appeared on
      the scene. Don ran straight on, apparently not perceiving them. They, on
      the contrary, saw him, and bore down upon him swiftly. Their cries,
      doubtless, warned him of his danger, for now he pulled up short, looked
      ahead, glanced quickly over his shoulder, and then&mdash;&mdash;-
    </p>
    <p>
      With a groan Jack turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A loud outcry from the blacks, however, drew his gaze seawards again, and
      as he looked his pulses thrilled. Don was making straight for the surf!
    </p>
    <p>
      As often happens on these coasts when the wind is but a whisper, and the
      sea glass-like in its placidity, a heavy ground-swell was rolling sullenly
      in from the outer bay. A stone's throw from the shore this swell was but a
      sinuous, almost imperceptible, undulation of the glassy surface; but as it
      swept towards the beach, where the water shoaled rapidly, of a sudden it
      reared aloft a crest of hissing foam, which curled higher and higher as it
      came on, until it overtopped the sands at the height of a boat's mast.
      Then with a mighty roar it broke, hurled itself far up the shelving sands,
      and retired, seething, to make room for the green battalions pressing
      shorewards in its wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Straight towards this living wall of water Don ran. The two bands of
      natives, uniting their forces as they swerved aside like bloodhounds in
      pursuit, were close upon him. Before, above him, curled the mighty wave;
      and then, to his great horror, Jack saw him stumble and fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lucky fall! Ere the natives could throw themselves upon him, the combing
      wave broke, passed directly over his prostrate body, swept the niggers off
      their legs, and hurled them with irresistible force far up the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later the breathless watchers on the cliff saw a black object
      floating on the surface of the water, yards from shore. It was Don. The
      under-tow had swept him out to sea, beyond his pursuers' reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      An expert and powerful swimmer, he lost no time in increasing the distance
      between himself and the disconcerted native crew, one or two of whom
      attempted to overtake him, but soon gave it up for a bad job.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a boat put off from the schooner, and soon Jack had the satisfaction
      of seeing his plucky friend hauled' in over her side. A quarter of an hour
      later, when the boat had regained the schooner, the signal gun once more
      boomed out over the sea, and with feelings of devout thankfulness to
      Heaven Jack realised that Don was safe on board, and that the term of his
      own and his companions' imprisonment on the summit of the Rock was bounded
      by a few brief hours at the most.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as he looked, as if by magic the schooner's canvas swelled to the
      breeze, and he caught the distant song of the lascars as they hove the
      anchor to the cathead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hunger, thirst, his wound, the very enemy at the foot of the rock stairs&mdash;all
      had been forgotten in the breathless interest inspired by Don's race for
      life; were forgotten still as he and the blacks stood watching the
      schooner get under weigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till a sharp clank of metal, as of a spear carelessly let fall, recalled
      their roving thoughts, and brought, them swiftly to the right-about, to
      find the Rock in the immediate vicinity of the pit's mouth literally
      swarming with armed natives.

      CHAPTER XXIV.&mdash;IN THE NICK OF TIME.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he surprise had
      been cleverly executed. Another moment, and Jack and his black attendants
      would have been surrounded. As it was, the odds were dead against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unexpected appearance of the schooner had evidently wrought a complete
      change in the tactics of the enemy. So here they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sleek, corpulent native who led the escaladers was none other than
      old Salambo!
    </p>
    <p>
      Salambo, the shark-charmer, thief, and director-in-chief of the harassing
      attacks by which they, the party of adventurers in search of what was
      indisputably their own, had been baffled at every turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      By means of the lascar's murderous hand he had clutched at the captain's
      throat and taken the captain's life. And now that his tool was for ever
      wrenched from his grasp, he had come in person to add the finishing-stroke
      to his evil work. Jack's blood boiled as he thought of it. One swift
      glance around, and his course was taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The temple, Spottie! Point for the temple, Pug!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The natives, perceiving their intention, swerved aside and attempted to
      cut them off. But so unexpected was Jack's manouvre, so prompt the
      obedience of Spottie and Puggles, that the attempt proved unsuccessful. A
      wild, breathless dash, and they had turned the corner of the temple&mdash;whose
      door, as usual, faced east&mdash;and crossed its threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old and neglected as the edifice was, stout wooden doors still swung upon
      the rust-eaten hinges. To slam these to and thrust the bolts home, top and
      bottom, was the work of but a moment. Bosin darted in as the great doors
      swung into place, narrowly escaping the amputation of his tail as the
      penalty of his tardiness. Scarcely had the last bolt been shot when up
      trooped the enemy, howling like hyenas, and commenced a determined assault
      upon the doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first they hurled themselves upon the barrier and attempted to force it
      in by sheer imposition of weight. Thud followed thud in furious
      succession, while Jack stood by with palpitating heart. His fears as to
      the stability of the doors, however, were soon set at rest. They creaked,
      yielded a little, but otherwise stood as firm as the solid masonry in
      which they were framed. The natives were not slow to discover this, and
      the ill-advised attempt was soon abandoned. In the brief lull that
      followed Jack looked about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside here, beneath the cobwebbed, blackened roof of the outer temple,
      the light was funereal in its dimness. What little there was crept in
      through the cracks in the shrunken doors in a reluctant sort of way, as if
      it found the society of bats and spiders anything but agreeable; except at
      the further or western end of the temple, where there was a second
      chamber, smaller and somewhat better lighted than the first. Eight feet or
      so above the floor a small square window pierced the wall, and directly
      beneath this stood a sort of stone pediment or shrine, on which squatted a
      hideously distorted image. This was the temple <i>swami</i>, and <i>swami's</i>
      ugly head reached to within a couple of feet of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second attempt was now made upon the doors, though not after the
      haphazard fashion of the first. The cracks in the shrunken woodwork
      attracting the attention of the natives, they fell to work on the widest
      of these, and with their spears began chipping away the plank splinter by
      splinter. But the extreme toughness of the material, seasoned as it was by
      unnumbered years of exposure to the elements, rendered the task of
      demolition both difficult and slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take you a jolly long time to get your ugly head-pieces through that,
      anyhow!&rdquo; muttered Jack, as he watched&mdash;or rather listened to, for he
      could see little or nothing of what was going on outside&mdash;the fast
      and furious play of the spears. &ldquo;And when you do get 'em through, why then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To symbolise what would happen then, Jack did what was certainly quite
      excusable under the circumstances&mdash;spat in his palm, and with immense
      gusto decapitated an imaginary nigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, given sufficient time for the spears to do their work, it was a
      foregone conclusion that the doors must fall. Would they hold out till the
      schooner cast anchor off the creek? He allowed an hour for that&mdash;an
      hour from the time the anchor was weighed.. Well, they&mdash;he and-the
      two blacks&mdash;had been in the temple the best part of an hour already.
      So that was all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then, the rescue party must make their way up the creek, and from the
      creek to the&mdash;summit of the Bock, along that passage by which Don and
      the blacks had entered on the previous day. This would consume another
      hour. He made the calculation with the utmost coolness; only, when it was
      finished, and he asked himself whether the doors would hold out that other
      hour, the reluctant &ldquo;No&rdquo; with which he was compelled to answer the
      question somehow stuck in his throat and nearly choked him. By way of
      relief, he slashed the head off another imaginary nigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second hour wore on. The gap in the door grew wider and wider beneath
      the ceaseless play of the spears, and still the natives showed no signs of
      desisting or of taking their departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a shadow darkened the little window at the rear of the temple.
      Jack turned on his heel expecting to see a native, but instead saw only
      Bosin. The monkey had clambered up the image, and so reached the window.
      The sight of the creature gave Jack a sudden inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was to hinder the blacks and himself from beating a noiseless retreat
      by way of this same window? The aperture was quite ample in size to admit
      of their squeezing through it. But&mdash;his wounded arm! And could the
      thing be done without attracting the attention of the gang about the
      doors?
    </p>
    <p>
      He climbed up the image and looked out. So far as he could discover the
      way was clear. Between that end of the temple and the stairs leading to
      the pit, not a single native was to be seen. True, his view was but
      limited at the best&mdash;the aperture was so narrow, and a straggling
      blackskin or two might, after all, have their eyes on the window, or,
      worse still, be guarding the stairs. Probably, though&mdash;and this
      seemed the more likely view&mdash;the entire force and attention of the
      belligerents were concentrated upon the temple doors. He would risk it,
      anyhow!
    </p>
    <p>
      Once gain the pit, and they were as good as saved; for by that time the
      rescue party could not be far off.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wilder shout from the besiegers recalled his thoughts and eyes to the
      doors. He scrambled down off the idols head and ran into the outer
      chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was that peculiar crackling sound&mdash;this pungent odour with which
      the air had suddenly grown so heavy? Fire&mdash;smoke! They had set fire
      to the doors!
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran back into the inner chamber. The blacks were there, cowering in
      terror against the wall. In a few hurried words he directed them how to
      proceed. They pulled themselves together and prepared to obey the sahib's
      directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The window, lads! through the window! Quick now, you lazy beggars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Spottie went first&mdash;somewhat unwillingly, it must be confessed, which
      was scarcely to be wondered at, considering that the drop from the window
      might land him in the arms of the enemy, or on the point of a spear. The
      smallness of the aperture, its height from the ground, and the necessity
      for going through it feet foremost, made a triple difficulty, too. But
      with Jack's assistance this was speedily overcome, and Spottie dropped out
      of sight. Barring the faint thud of his bare feet on the rock, no sound
      followed. Thus far, then, the stratagem had escaped detection. Jack began
      to breathe easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Spottie went Puggles&mdash;with even more difficulty, for, as the
      reader is aware, Puggles was extremely fat; and again all was still
      without. Within there was noise enough and to spare. The crackling of the
      burning doors had grown ominously loud. As Pug's black head disappeared,
      too, a tremendous shout burst from the rabble gathered about the entrance.
      Its significance Jack did not stop to inquire. Already he had scaled the
      image. A wry face or two at the pain of his wounded arm, and a moment
      later he stood beside the blacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment of their flight was well chosen. The natives, to a man, were
      watching the doors with all their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bidding the blacks follow close at his heels, he sped across the few yards
      of rock that separated the temple from the stairs, sprang down the steps,
      and fell insensible at the feet of his friend, Roydon Leigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rescue party had arrived in the very nick of time.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.&mdash;THE SHARK-CHARMER IS CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter all, Jack was
      but human. His fortitude, strung to a tense pitch by those terrible days
      and nights of danger, snapped, in presence of actual safety, like an
      overdrawn bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pitiful spectacle he presented, his clothes torn to ribbons, his hands
      and face grimy, bloodstained, yet ghastly in their pallor. Don uttered a
      cry and flung himself on his knees beside his chum. He thought him dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not dead, thank God! Only done up. He'll be all right soon,&rdquo; said
      Captain Leigh, with his hand upon Jack's heart, which still beat, though
      faintly; and taking out a pocket-flask he poured a few drops of brandy
      between the drawn, bloodless lips of the unconscious lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under this stimulating treatment Jack soon came round. Needless to dwell
      on the confusion into which his thoughts were thrown by the sight of the
      familiar faces bending over him. His bewilderment, however, was but
      momentary. Memory returned with a rush and spurred him to action and
      speech. He sat bolt upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got the rascal?&rdquo; he demanded in eager tones..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What rascal?&rdquo; asked Don.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The shark-charmer, to be sure. Who else should I mean? He's on the Rock,
      I tell you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him done stick his leg in trap, sa'b,&rdquo; interpolated Puggles, with
      appropriate action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don started to his feet. Jack followed suit, somewhat unsteadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he above there?&rdquo; cried Captain Leigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; said Jack eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up with you, boys!&rdquo; cried the captain to the <i>peons</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don had already acquainted his father with the shark-charmer's part in the
      tragic events of the past week, and the <i>peons</i> had overheard the
      story. They all knew the shark-charmer, and they followed their leader
      with enthusiasm. They carried carbines; these glinted in the sunshine, and
      clanked against the contracted walls of the rock stairway as they jostled
      each other in the ascent.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rush of many feet above, and the natives appeared at the stair-head.
      Only the moment before had they discovered the temple to be deserted, and
      become alive to the fact that they had lingered too long on the Rock. They
      were now in hot pursuit of the fugitives. But the sudden apparition of the
      red-sashed <i>peons</i>, the ominous glint and clash of the carbines,
      promised hotter pursuit than they had bargained for. A wave of
      consternation swept through their ranks. <i>Sauve qui peut!</i> In
      headlong flight they scattered in all directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As before, the shark-charmer had led the gang. He almost ran into the arms
      of the <i>peons</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rama! Rama!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the cry of a coward and miscreant who knows that his last hour of
      freedom, if not of life, has come: the hour of reckoning for his misdeeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      For as long as it took his half-paralysed tongue to frame the words, the
      shark-charmer faced his approaching doom. Then he turned and fled like a
      frightened cur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of Captain Leigh rang out on the air clear and full as the note
      of a bugle:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After him, lads! Never mind the others! Take the fellow alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up scrambled the <i>peons</i> in obedience to the command, deploying to
      right and left in a long, semicircular line as they debouched upon the
      Rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Off they went at the quick; then, with a wild cheer, broke into a loping
      run, the extremities of the semicircle closing in as they advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shark-charmer ran towards the Elephant's head, where the precipice was
      the loftiest and dizziest of the four, the beach lying full three hundred
      feet below. Whatever chance of escape he possessed, it assuredly did not
      lie in that direction. To all human seeming his escape was an utter
      impossibility. So thought the <i>peons</i>, and slackened speed, though
      the extremities of the living, steel-crested semicircle still closed in
      and in. Between, and somewhat ahead, ran the shark-charmer. He could not
      run much farther; the brink of the precipice was only a few yards away. He
      was caught!
    </p>
    <p>
      What the thoughts of the guilty, hunted wretch were during those awful
      moments, God alone knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>peons</i> had slowed down to a walk now&mdash;a walk confident, yet
      timid. They were altogether sure of the shark-charmer, and not a little
      afraid of the precipice. Not so the fugitive; for him all fear lay behind.
      He advanced to the very brink of the cliff. His arms dropped at his sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      In upon him closed his pursuers with cat-like tread and alert eyes. They
      had no desire to be dashed over the cliff. Besides, was he not as good as
      caught? A mere span of rock divided him from their grasp. He stood
      motionless, half-turned towards them, apparently resigned to his fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, however, hurling upon the close-drawn ranks a swift look of
      defiance, he wheeled full-face to the sea; wheeled, and drew his arms up
      and back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Leigh was the first to perceive the significance of the movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seize him!&rdquo; he shouted, dashing through the line of <i>peons</i>; &ldquo;quick,
      or he'll be over!... Good God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He fell back appalled. A stifled cry of horror broke from the <i>peons</i>.
      The shark-charmer had leapt into mid-air.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.&mdash;BRINGS THE QUEST TO AN END.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ilent and pale as
      death, Don turned and stood for a moment facing Haunted Pagoda Hill, with
      head bared. His thoughts were with the captain as he had seen him on that
      terrible evening of the murder. Plainer than words his attitude cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Avenged!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other natives had taken advantage of the opportunity afforded by the
      pursuit of the shark-charmer to make good their escape. Captain Leigh
      accordingly ordered the <i>peons</i> back to the schooner. Their mission
      was at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of the stairs they came upon Bosin. The monkey at once
      clambered on to Don's shoulder, happier far than his new master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, too, as they were about to turn their backs upon the spot where
      death had hovered in ever-narrowing circles about their heads through the
      hopeless hours of that awful night and day, Jack and Don joined hands and
      silently renewed the friendship which had here been put to so crucial a
      test. Our boy-friendships seldom pass the boundary line of youth and
      manhood; or, if they do, too often become tarnished and neglected things
      in which we find no pleasure. Theirs, just then, seemed fit to last a
      lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say!&rdquo; cried Jack abruptly, when he had done wringing his chunks hand,
      &ldquo;what about the pearls, old fellow? You're surely not going off without
      them after all the trouble we've had? I'm not, anyhow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack was nothing if not practical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Leigh, who was standing by, overheard the words, and approached
      with a curious, not to say mysterious, smile on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! not had enough of it yet, Jack?&rdquo; said he, in bantering tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I, sir! Where's the use of being half cut to bits if one doesn't get
      what one's after? I shan't be content till I handle the shiners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where do you purpose looking for them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jack's face fell.. It was not easy to find an answer to this question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I can assist you,&rdquo; continued Captain Leigh, with a repetition of
      his mysterious smile. &ldquo;This quest of yours, boys, has been a string of
      surprises from the very start, judging by what I have heard and seen of
      it. So, just to keep the ball rolling, we'll wind up with the biggest
      surprise of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And slipping his fingers into his waistcoat pocket, to the astonishment of
      the young men he drew therefrom the identical wash-leather case which they
      had all along, and with good reason, supposed to be in the shark-charmer's
      possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;how&mdash;?&rdquo; Don began, hardly able to believe his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you see how it is?&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;The governor's running a rig on us.
      Old Salambo took the pearls, but left the bag; it's empty, of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Leigh quietly turned the pouch upside-down, and poured into the
      palm of his left hand a little silvery heap with a shimmer of pale gold in
      its midst. This he pushed into full view with his finger. It was the
      Golden Pearl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean to say we've been on a wild-goose chase all this time?&rdquo;
       gasped Jack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A downright fool's errand!&rdquo; muttered Don, in tones of intense disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; neither one nor the other,&rdquo; interposed Captain Leigh. &ldquo;Don't go
      scattering self-accusations of that sort about before you hear my
      explanation&mdash;though it's a queer business, I must acknowledge,&rdquo; he
      added, with a laugh. &ldquo;Will you hear it out now or wait till we go on
      board?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us one thing,&rdquo; put in Don; &ldquo;were the pearls stolen at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they were not, or I should not be able to produce them. But the
      shark-charmer was none the less a thief, for all that. But I see you're on
      tenterhooks to hear all about it, so I'll read you the riddle at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carefully restoring the pearls to the pouch, he handed the treasure to
      Don, and then resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It goes without saying, of course, that you remember the evening you
      brought the pearls on board. Well, shortly after you had placed them in
      the locker&mdash;you had just turned in, I think&mdash;I got an uneasy
      sort of feeling that they were not as safe there as they should be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you took them into your state-room!&rdquo; interrupted Don, who thought he
      began to see light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. The companion door was open, you recollect, and the
      shark-charmer, I suppose, must have been hanging about at the moment and
      seen me. Very imprudently, as it turned out, I left my door on the latch,
      though I took the precaution to put the pearls under my pillow. You
      remember, perhaps, my paying off some of the men that afternoon? Well,
      when I turned in I left the bag of rupees&mdash;or rather what remained of
      them, about two hundred in all, I should think&mdash;on the sofa opposite
      my berth, and my gold chronometer on the stand at my head, as I always do.
      I slept like a top until I was called at three, when we got under weigh.
      At this time, you understand, I was under the impression that you two were
      snug between the sheets. The schooner was a dozen miles down the coast
      before I found out my mistake. Being due in Colombo the following day, you
      see, I couldn't put back. Neither could I make head nor tail of your
      disappearance until the carrier brought your letter, Don. That made the
      whole matter plain enough. You had found the locker empty, supposed that
      the shark-charmer had stolen the pearls, and had given chase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; cried Jack, &ldquo;what I said a minute ago was right enough, after all.
      The pearls were safe, and we've been on a jolly wild-goose chase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; that doesn't follow. The shark-charmer left the schooner far from
      empty-handed. He stole the bag of rupees and the watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but what about the handkerchief the pearls were tied up in?&rdquo; asked
      Don. &ldquo;I fished it out of the water off the island here. How do you account
      for that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have thrown the handkerchief on the sofa. Probably the fellow
      snatched it up with the bag of rupees, thinking that it still contained
      the pearls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And threw it away when he found that it didn't,&rdquo; chuckled Jack. &ldquo;Well,
      the shiners are all right, anyhow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nightfall found the schooner bowling towards the open sea under full sail.
      Three figures stood grouped on her deck in the fading twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was just about here,&rdquo; said Don in a choked voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Here, a sheer hulk, lies poor Tom Bowling,

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the
Foundation&rdquo; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; appears, or with which the
phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
